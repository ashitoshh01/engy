The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following components:

1. Main Flask app:
   - Handles routing and API endpoints
   - Initializes the CrewAI agents and tasks

2. Research Agent:
   - Uses CrewAI to create agents for searching and scraping information
   - Implements the following agents:
     a. PersonSearcher: Searches for basic information about the person
     b. ContactFinder: Finds email addresses and additional details

3. API Endpoints:
   - POST /search: Accepts a person's name, triggers the research process
   - GET /status: Returns the current status and step logs of the research process

4. Websocket:
   - Implements real-time updates for step logs

5. Data Storage:
   - In-memory storage for search results and step logs
   - Option to persist data to a lightweight database like SQLite

6. Error Handling:
   - Graceful error handling for API requests and agent operations

The server will use the CrewAI library to create and manage agents, similar to the provided example code. It will adapt the agents and tasks to focus on person-specific research instead of company searches.
