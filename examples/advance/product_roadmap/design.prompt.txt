You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
Plan for the different stages of product development and monitor upcoming deadlines
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a design for a simple product development planning and deadline monitoring app based on the given description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following components:

1. Database:
   - Use SQLite for simplicity
   - Tables:
     - Projects (id, name, description, start_date, end_date)
     - Stages (id, project_id, name, description, start_date, end_date, status)
     - Tasks (id, stage_id, name, description, deadline, status)

2. API Endpoints:
   - GET /projects: Retrieve all projects
   - POST /projects: Create a new project
   - GET /projects/<project_id>: Retrieve a specific project
   - PUT /projects/<project_id>: Update a project
   - DELETE /projects/<project_id>: Delete a project
   
   - GET /projects/<project_id>/stages: Retrieve all stages for a project
   - POST /projects/<project_id>/stages: Create a new stage for a project
   - PUT /stages/<stage_id>: Update a stage
   - DELETE /stages/<stage_id>: Delete a stage
   
   - GET /stages/<stage_id>/tasks: Retrieve all tasks for a stage
   - POST /stages/<stage_id>/tasks: Create a new task for a stage
   - PUT /tasks/<task_id>: Update a task
   - DELETE /tasks/<task_id>: Delete a task

3. Business Logic:
   - Calculate progress percentages for projects and stages
   - Identify upcoming deadlines (within the next 7 days)
   - Sort and filter projects, stages, and tasks by various criteria

4. Data Validation:
   - Ensure date consistency (e.g., end dates after start dates)
   - Validate required fields and data types

5. Error Handling:
   - Proper HTTP status codes and error messages for various scenarios

6. Security:
   - Basic authentication for API access
   - Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection

The backend will serve the static HTML file for the frontend and handle all data operations through the API endpoints.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript, featuring a responsive design for various screen sizes. Key components include:

1. Header:
   - App title: "ProductPlan Pro"
   - Navigation menu (Projects, Deadlines, Settings)

2. Main content area:
   - Project List:
     - Sortable and filterable table of projects
     - Progress bars for each project
     - Quick actions (edit, delete)
   - Project Details (shown when a project is selected):
     - Project information (name, description, dates)
     - Stages list with progress bars
     - Tasks list with checkboxes and deadline indicators

3. Sidebar:
   - "Add New" button (for projects, stages, or tasks)
   - Upcoming Deadlines widget
     - List of tasks due within the next 7 days
     - Color-coded by urgency

4. Footer:
   - Copyright information
   - Links to help/documentation

5. Modals:
   - Add/Edit Project
   - Add/Edit Stage
   - Add/Edit Task

6. Styling:
   - Modern, clean design with a blue and white color scheme
   - Responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
   - Smooth transitions and animations for a polished feel

7. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Dynamic content loading without page refresh
   - Form validation for adding/editing items
   - Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering stages and tasks
   - Interactive charts for visualizing project progress
   - Real-time updates of deadlines and progress bars

8. Accessibility:
   - Proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - High contrast mode toggle

The frontend will communicate with the backend through AJAX calls to the API endpoints, providing a smooth and responsive user experience for planning and monitoring product development stages and deadlines.
