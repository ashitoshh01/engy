You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software architecture.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend).
You only write the design doc with high-level structure and psudocode, no need to write actual code.  

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

# The problem to solve:
<PROBLEM>
Create an app that captures the camera, does the detection and count how many people in the frame.
</PROBLEM>

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

I'll design a simple web app that uses the device camera to count people in real-time. Here's the design:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
Python Flask Server Design:

1. Dependencies:
- Flask
- OpenCV (cv2)
- numpy
- mediapipe (for person detection)

2. Server Routes:
```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Serve the main HTML page
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/process_frame', methods=['POST'])
def process_frame():
    # Endpoint to receive frame data and return person count
    # - Receive base64 encoded image from frontend
    # - Decode image to numpy array
    # - Run person detection using mediapipe
    # - Count detected persons
    # - Return JSON with count and bounding boxes
    return {
        'person_count': count,
        'boxes': bounding_boxes
    }
```

3. Person Detection Logic:
```python
class PersonDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize mediapipe pose detection
        self.pose_detector = mp.solutions.pose.Pose()
    
    def detect(self, frame):
        # Process frame
        # Return count and bounding boxes
        pass
```

4. Configuration:
- MIME types for image processing
- Maximum frame size
- Detection confidence threshold
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
Single Page HTML/JavaScript Design:

1. HTML Structure:
```html
<div class="container">
    <!-- Video feed container -->
    <div class="video-container">
        <video id="videoElement" autoplay></video>
        <canvas id="overlayCanvas"></canvas>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Stats display -->
    <div class="stats-panel">
        <h2>People Count: <span id="countDisplay">0</span></h2>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Controls -->
    <div class="controls">
        <button id="startButton">Start Detection</button>
        <button id="stopButton">Stop</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

2. JavaScript Components:
```javascript
// Camera handling
class CameraManager {
    // Initialize camera stream
    // Handle permissions
    // Setup video element
}

// Frame Processing
class FrameProcessor {
    // Capture frame from video
    // Convert to base64
    // Send to backend
    // Process response
    // Draw overlay
}

// Main App Logic
class PeopleCounterApp {
    // Initialize components
    // Handle start/stop
    // Update UI
    // Process frames at interval
}
```

3. Styling:
- Responsive layout
- Video feed takes 70% of viewport
- Overlay canvas for drawing bounding boxes
- Stats panel with large counter
- Material design-inspired controls

4. Features:
- Real-time camera feed
- Bounding box overlay for detected persons
- Counter display
- Start/Stop controls
- Error handling for no camera access
