Here's my design for the stock and investment expert agent app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
1. Dependencies:
   - Flask for web server
   - SQLite for local database
   - CrewAI for agent functionality
   - requests for API calls
   - beautifulsoup4 for web scraping

2. Database Schema:
   - Table: news_entries
     - id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
     - timestamp (DATETIME)
     - title (TEXT)
     - content (TEXT)
     - source (TEXT)
     - sentiment (TEXT)

3. Agent Class:
   - StockNewsAgent
     - Methods:
       - search_news(company_symbol)
       - analyze_sentiment(news_content)
       - store_news_entry(news_data)

4. Flask Routes:
   - GET /: Serve the main HTML page
   - POST /run: Start the agent
   - POST /stop: Stop the agent
   - GET /news: Retrieve news entries (with pagination and search)

5. Background Task:
   - Use threading to run the agent in the background
   - Implement a flag to control the agent's running state

6. Main Application Logic:
   - Initialize Flask app, database, and agent
   - Implement route handlers
   - Manage agent's running state
   - Handle database operations

7. Error Handling:
   - Implement try-except blocks for API calls and database operations
   - Return appropriate error messages to the frontend

8. Configuration:
   - Store API keys and other sensitive information in environment variables
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
1. HTML Structure:
   - Header with app title
   - Control section with Run and Stop buttons
   - News table section
   - Pagination controls
   - Search input

2. CSS Styling:
   - Use a modern, responsive design
   - Apply a color scheme suitable for a financial app (e.g., blue and white)
   - Style the table for easy readability
   - Make buttons stand out with hover effects

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Implement AJAX calls to backend API
   - Handle Run and Stop button clicks
   - Update news table dynamically
   - Implement pagination logic
   - Add search functionality
   - Display loading indicators during API calls

4. Table Design:
   - Columns: Timestamp, Title, Source, Sentiment
   - Sortable columns
   - Alternating row colors for better readability

5. Responsive Design:
   - Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes

6. User Feedback:
   - Display toast notifications for agent status (started/stopped)
   - Show error messages if API calls fail

7. Accessibility:
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Add ARIA labels where necessary
   - Ensure proper color contrast

8. Performance Optimization:
   - Minimize DOM manipulation
   - Use event delegation for dynamic elements
   - Implement debounce for search input

9. Additional Features:
