Here's my design for the restaurant picker app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
Python Flask server:

1. Main route ('/'):
   - Serve the HTML page

2. API route ('/get_restaurant'):
   - Use Yelp Fusion API to search for restaurants
   - Parameters:
     - location: "SF Bay Area"
     - categories: "chinese"
     - limit: 50 (to get a good variety)
   - Randomly select one restaurant from the results
   - Return JSON with restaurant details:
     - name
     - address
     - rating
     - price
     - phone
     - image_url
     - yelp_url

3. Dependencies:
   - Flask
   - requests (for API calls)
   - python-dotenv (for managing API keys)

4. Configuration:
   - Store Yelp API key in .env file

5. Error handling:
   - Handle API errors and return appropriate error messages
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
Single HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

1. Header:
   - Title: "SF Bay Area Chinese Restaurant Picker"
   - Subtitle: "Let us decide where you'll have dinner tonight!"

2. Main content:
   - Large "Pick a Restaurant" button
   - Restaurant info display area (initially hidden):
     - Restaurant name (large font)
     - Address
     - Rating (with stars)
     - Price range
     - Phone number
     - Restaurant image
     - "View on Yelp" button (links to Yelp page)

3. Footer:
   - Created by [Your Name]
   - Powered by Yelp

4. Styling:
   - Use a clean, modern design with a Chinese-inspired color scheme (red and gold)
   - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
   - Animations for button press and restaurant info reveal

5. JavaScript functionality:
   - onClick event for "Pick a Restaurant" button:
     - Show loading spinner
     - Make AJAX call to backend '/get_restaurant' endpoint
     - Hide loading spinner
     - Display restaurant information in the info area
     - Animate the reveal of the info area

6. Error handling:
   - Display error messages if the API call fails
