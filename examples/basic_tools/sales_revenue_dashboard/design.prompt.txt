Here's a design for the app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following components:

1. Data Storage:
   - Use SQLite database to store sales data
   - Table structure: id, product_name, sale_date, quantity, price

2. API Endpoints:
   - GET /api/quarterly_revenue
     - Returns quarterly revenue data for the dashboard
   - GET /api/quarterly_breakdown/<quarter>
     - Returns detailed breakdown for a specific quarter
   - GET /api/sales_report
     - Generates and returns a sales report
   - POST /api/sales_report
     - Accepts edited sales report data and saves it

3. Data Processing:
   - Implement functions to calculate quarterly revenue
   - Create functions to generate detailed breakdowns
   - Develop a report generator using a template engine (e.g., Jinja2)

4. Libraries:
   - Flask: Web framework
   - SQLAlchemy: Database ORM
   - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
   - Jinja2: Templating engine for report generation

5. File Structure:
   - app.py: Main Flask application
   - models.py: Database models
   - utils.py: Helper functions for data processing
   - templates/: Folder for report templates

The server will handle data retrieval, processing, and report generation, serving the frontend with JSON responses for the dashboard and providing downloadable reports.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS, featuring an interactive dashboard and report editing functionality:

1. Layout:
   - Header with app title and navigation
   - Main content area divided into two sections:
     - Dashboard
     - Sales Report Editor

2. Dashboard Section:
   - Quarterly revenue chart (bar chart)
   - Interactive elements to drill down into each quarter
   - Detailed breakdown view for selected quarter

3. Sales Report Section:
   - Report template display
   - Editable fields for customizing the report
   - Generate and Download buttons

4. Technologies:
   - HTML5 for structure
   - CSS3 for styling (using Flexbox or Grid for layout)
   - JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity
   - Chart.js for creating interactive charts
   - Fetch API for making AJAX calls to the backend

5. Features:
   - Real-time updates of the dashboard when drilling down
   - In-place editing of the sales report
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes

6. User Interaction:
   - Click on quarters in the main chart to see detailed breakdowns
   - Edit report fields directly in the browser
   - Generate updated reports based on edits
   - Download reports as PDF or CSV

The frontend will provide an intuitive, interactive experience for viewing sales data and customizing reports, all within a single page application.
