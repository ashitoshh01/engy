You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
Create an agent using CrewAI that connects to my gmail and summarize all my recent emails.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a design for the app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server that handles the following:

1. Gmail API Integration:
   - Use the Google Gmail API to authenticate and access the user's Gmail account
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow for secure authentication

2. Email Retrieval:
   - Fetch recent emails (e.g., last 50 emails) from the user's inbox

3. CrewAI Integration:
   - Set up a CrewAI agent specialized in email summarization
   - Define the agent's role, goals, and tools for email processing

4. Email Summarization:
   - Pass each email to the CrewAI agent for summarization
   - Collect and organize the summarized results

5. API Endpoints:
   - /auth: Handle Gmail authentication
   - /callback: Process OAuth callback
   - /summarize: Trigger email retrieval and summarization process
   - /results: Return summarized email results

6. Data Storage:
   - Store authentication tokens securely
   - Cache summarized results for quick retrieval

Key Python libraries:
- Flask: Web framework
- google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib: For Gmail API authentication
- crewai: For creating and managing the AI agent
- langchain: For potential integration with CrewAI

The server will handle authentication, email retrieval, and interaction with the CrewAI agent to produce email summaries.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript for dynamic content updates. The design will include:

1. Header:
   - App title: "Email Summarizer"
   - User info display (once authenticated)

2. Authentication Section:
   - "Connect to Gmail" button
   - Authentication status indicator

3. Control Panel:
   - "Summarize Recent Emails" button
   - Options for number of emails to summarize (e.g., dropdown: 10, 25, 50)

4. Results Display:
   - Loading spinner during summarization process
   - Accordion-style list of email summaries:
     * Each item shows: Subject, From, Date, and a preview of the summary
     * Clicking an item expands to show the full summary

5. Styling:
   - Clean, modern design with a color scheme based on Gmail's palette
   - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop viewing

6. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Handle authentication flow
   - Make AJAX calls to backend API endpoints
   - Dynamically update the UI with summarization results
   - Implement accordion behavior for summary display

7. Error Handling:
   - Display user-friendly error messages for various scenarios (auth failure, summarization issues, etc.)

The page will use HTML5, CSS3 (possibly with a framework like Bootstrap for responsiveness), and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. All functionality will be contained within this single page, providing a seamless user experience for email summarization.
