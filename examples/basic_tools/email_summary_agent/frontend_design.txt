The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript for dynamic content updates. The design will include:

1. Header:
   - App title: "Email Summarizer"
   - User info display (once authenticated)

2. Authentication Section:
   - "Connect to Gmail" button
   - Authentication status indicator

3. Control Panel:
   - "Summarize Recent Emails" button
   - Options for number of emails to summarize (e.g., dropdown: 10, 25, 50)

4. Results Display:
   - Loading spinner during summarization process
   - Accordion-style list of email summaries:
     * Each item shows: Subject, From, Date, and a preview of the summary
     * Clicking an item expands to show the full summary

5. Styling:
   - Clean, modern design with a color scheme based on Gmail's palette
   - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop viewing

6. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Handle authentication flow
   - Make AJAX calls to backend API endpoints
   - Dynamically update the UI with summarization results
   - Implement accordion behavior for summary display

7. Error Handling:
   - Display user-friendly error messages for various scenarios (auth failure, summarization issues, etc.)

The page will use HTML5, CSS3 (possibly with a framework like Bootstrap for responsiveness), and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. All functionality will be contained within this single page, providing a seamless user experience for email summarization.
