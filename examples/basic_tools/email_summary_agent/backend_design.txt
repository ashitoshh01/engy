The backend will be a Python Flask server that handles the following:

1. Gmail API Integration:
   - Use the Google Gmail API to authenticate and access the user's Gmail account
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow for secure authentication

2. Email Retrieval:
   - Fetch recent emails (e.g., last 50 emails) from the user's inbox

3. CrewAI Integration:
   - Set up a CrewAI agent specialized in email summarization
   - Define the agent's role, goals, and tools for email processing

4. Email Summarization:
   - Pass each email to the CrewAI agent for summarization
   - Collect and organize the summarized results

5. API Endpoints:
   - /auth: Handle Gmail authentication
   - /callback: Process OAuth callback
   - /summarize: Trigger email retrieval and summarization process
   - /results: Return summarized email results

6. Data Storage:
   - Store authentication tokens securely
   - Cache summarized results for quick retrieval

Key Python libraries:
- Flask: Web framework
- google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib: For Gmail API authentication
- crewai: For creating and managing the AI agent
- langchain: For potential integration with CrewAI

The server will handle authentication, email retrieval, and interaction with the CrewAI agent to produce email summaries.
