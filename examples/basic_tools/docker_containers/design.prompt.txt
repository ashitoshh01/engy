You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
create a dashboard show all running docker containers.
And let me able to kill them, ssh to them or inspect them.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a design for the Docker container management dashboard app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server that interacts with the Docker daemon to retrieve container information and perform actions. Key components:

1. Docker API Integration:
   - Use the `docker` Python library to interact with Docker
   - Implement functions to:
     - List all running containers
     - Kill a container
     - Get container details for inspection
     - Execute commands in a container (for SSH-like functionality)

2. API Endpoints:
   - GET /containers: Return list of all running containers
   - POST /container/<container_id>/kill: Kill specified container
   - GET /container/<container_id>/inspect: Get detailed info about container
   - POST /container/<container_id>/exec: Execute command in container

3. WebSocket Support:
   - Implement WebSocket connection to push real-time updates about container status

4. Authentication:
   - Basic authentication system to ensure only authorized users can access and control containers

5. Logging:
   - Implement logging for all actions performed on containers

The server will run on port 5000 and serve the single HTML page for the frontend.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS for a responsive, dynamic user interface. Key features:

1. Container List:
   - Table displaying all running containers
   - Columns: Container ID, Name, Image, Status, Created, Ports
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

2. Action Buttons:
   - For each container: Kill, SSH, Inspect buttons
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (e.g., killing a container)

3. Inspection Modal:
   - Pop-up modal to display detailed container information
   - Formatted JSON view of container details

4. SSH Terminal:
   - In-browser terminal emulator for SSH-like access
   - Opens in a modal window
   - Supports basic terminal operations

5. Search and Filter:
   - Search bar to filter containers by name or ID
   - Dropdown to filter by status or image

6. Responsive Design:
   - Mobile-friendly layout using CSS flexbox/grid
   - Collapsible sidebar for additional options on desktop

7. Authentication:
   - Login form for user authentication
   - Session management using cookies or local storage

8. Notifications:
   - Toast notifications for action results (success/failure)

The page will use modern CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity, with the option to integrate a lightweight framework like Alpine.js for more complex state management if needed.
