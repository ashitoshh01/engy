The backend will be a Python Flask server that interacts with the Docker daemon to retrieve container information and perform actions. Key components:

1. Docker API Integration:
   - Use the `docker` Python library to interact with Docker
   - Implement functions to:
     - List all running containers
     - Kill a container
     - Get container details for inspection
     - Execute commands in a container (for SSH-like functionality)

2. API Endpoints:
   - GET /containers: Return list of all running containers
   - POST /container/<container_id>/kill: Kill specified container
   - GET /container/<container_id>/inspect: Get detailed info about container
   - POST /container/<container_id>/exec: Execute command in container

3. WebSocket Support:
   - Implement WebSocket connection to push real-time updates about container status

4. Authentication:
   - Basic authentication system to ensure only authorized users can access and control containers

5. Logging:
   - Implement logging for all actions performed on containers

The server will run on port 5000 and serve the single HTML page for the frontend.
