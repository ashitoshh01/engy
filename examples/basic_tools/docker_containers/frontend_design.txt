The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS for a responsive, dynamic user interface. Key features:

1. Container List:
   - Table displaying all running containers
   - Columns: Container ID, Name, Image, Status, Created, Ports
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

2. Action Buttons:
   - For each container: Kill, SSH, Inspect buttons
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (e.g., killing a container)

3. Inspection Modal:
   - Pop-up modal to display detailed container information
   - Formatted JSON view of container details

4. SSH Terminal:
   - In-browser terminal emulator for SSH-like access
   - Opens in a modal window
   - Supports basic terminal operations

5. Search and Filter:
   - Search bar to filter containers by name or ID
   - Dropdown to filter by status or image

6. Responsive Design:
   - Mobile-friendly layout using CSS flexbox/grid
   - Collapsible sidebar for additional options on desktop

7. Authentication:
   - Login form for user authentication
   - Session management using cookies or local storage

8. Notifications:
   - Toast notifications for action results (success/failure)

The page will use modern CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity, with the option to integrate a lightweight framework like Alpine.js for more complex state management if needed.
