The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS. Key features include:

1. File Upload Section:
   - A drag-and-drop area for file upload.
   - A traditional file input button as an alternative.
   - Visual feedback during file upload process.

2. Summary Display:
   - A styled div to display the markdown summary.
   - Use a markdown rendering library (e.g., marked.js) to properly format the summary.

3. Download Button:
   - A button to download the summarized markdown file.

4. Progress Indicator:
   - A loading spinner or progress bar to show when summarization is in progress.

5. Responsive Design:
   - Use CSS media queries to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. Error Messages:
   - A designated area to display any error messages from the backend.

7. Styling:
   - Use a modern, clean design with a color scheme that emphasizes readability.
   - Implement smooth transitions and animations for a polished user experience.

8. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Implement AJAX calls to communicate with the backend API.
   - Handle file upload, summary retrieval, and download functionality.
   - Dynamically update the UI based on the current state (uploading, processing, ready, error).

The HTML file will include all necessary CSS and JavaScript, making it a self-contained frontend solution.
