Here's a design for the app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following key components:

1. Flask app setup:
   - Import necessary libraries (Flask, speech_recognition, werkzeug)
   - Initialize Flask app

2. File upload route ('/upload'):
   - Accept POST requests with audio file
   - Save uploaded file temporarily
   - Use speech_recognition library to transcribe audio
   - Return transcription as JSON response

3. Main route ('/'):
   - Serve the HTML page

4. Error handling:
   - Handle file format errors
   - Handle transcription errors

5. Run the Flask app

Key libraries:
- Flask for the web server
- SpeechRecognition for audio transcription
- Werkzeug for file handling

The server will listen on localhost:5000 by default.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title
   - File input for audio upload
   - Button to trigger upload
   - Loading spinner (hidden by default)
   - Results area to display transcription

2. CSS styling:
   - Modern, clean design
   - Responsive layout
   - Styled file input and button
   - Animated loading spinner

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Handle file selection
   - Perform AJAX upload to server
   - Show/hide loading spinner
   - Display transcription results
   - Error handling and user feedback

4. Features:
   - Drag and drop file upload
   - File type validation (audio only)
   - Copy transcription to clipboard button
   - Character/word count display

The page will be fully responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
