The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions. Key components:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title "GCP Instance Manager"
   - Main content area for instance list
   - Modal for SSH command display
   - Loading spinner

2. CSS styling:
   - Use a modern CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for responsive design
   - Custom styles for instance cards, buttons, and modal

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Fetch and display instances on page load
   - Implement refresh button to update instance list
   - SSH button on each instance card to show SSH command in modal
   - Kill button on each instance card to stop the instance
   - Error handling and display for failed API calls

4. Instance display:
   - Create cards for each instance showing:
     - Instance name
     - Status (with color-coding)
     - Zone
     - SSH and Kill buttons

5. Modal for SSH command:
   - Display generated SSH command
   - Provide a copy-to-clipboard button

6. Responsive design:
   - Ensure the layout works well on both desktop and mobile devices

7. Error messages:
   - Display error notifications for failed API calls or actions

8. Confirmation dialogs:
   - Add confirmation step before killing an instance

9. Auto-refresh:
   - Implement periodic auto-refresh of instance list (e.g., every 30 seconds)
