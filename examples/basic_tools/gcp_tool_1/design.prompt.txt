You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
create a tool connect to gcp and list all my GCE instances. Let me can ssh or kill them.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a design for the GCP instance management app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server that interacts with Google Cloud Platform APIs. Key components:

1. Flask app setup:
   - Import necessary libraries (Flask, google-auth, google-auth-httplib2, googleapiclient)
   - Initialize Flask app

2. GCP authentication:
   - Use service account credentials or application default credentials
   - Authenticate with GCP APIs

3. Routes:
   a. GET /instances
      - Retrieve list of GCE instances using Compute Engine API
      - Return JSON with instance details (name, status, zone, etc.)

   b. POST /ssh
      - Receive instance name and zone
      - Generate SSH command for the instance
      - Return SSH command as response

   c. POST /kill
      - Receive instance name and zone
      - Use Compute Engine API to stop the instance
      - Return success/failure status

4. Helper functions:
   - get_compute_client(): Initialize and return GCP Compute Engine client
   - list_instances(): Fetch and format instance data
   - stop_instance(name, zone): Stop a specific instance

5. Error handling:
   - Implement try/except blocks for API calls
   - Return appropriate error messages and status codes

6. Run the Flask app with debug mode enabled for development
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions. Key components:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title "GCP Instance Manager"
   - Main content area for instance list
   - Modal for SSH command display
   - Loading spinner

2. CSS styling:
   - Use a modern CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for responsive design
   - Custom styles for instance cards, buttons, and modal

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Fetch and display instances on page load
   - Implement refresh button to update instance list
   - SSH button on each instance card to show SSH command in modal
   - Kill button on each instance card to stop the instance
   - Error handling and display for failed API calls

4. Instance display:
   - Create cards for each instance showing:
     - Instance name
     - Status (with color-coding)
     - Zone
     - SSH and Kill buttons

5. Modal for SSH command:
   - Display generated SSH command
   - Provide a copy-to-clipboard button

6. Responsive design:
   - Ensure the layout works well on both desktop and mobile devices

7. Error messages:
   - Display error notifications for failed API calls or actions

8. Confirmation dialogs:
   - Add confirmation step before killing an instance

9. Auto-refresh:
   - Implement periodic auto-refresh of instance list (e.g., every 30 seconds)
