   - downloadInvoice(): Trigger invoice download (PDF or PNG)

4. API interactions:
   - Use fetch() for AJAX calls to backend APIs

5. Libraries:
   - Use vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation
   - Consider using a lightweight CSS framework like Milligram for basic styling

6. Key features:
   - Real-time preview of invoice as user inputs data
   - Drag-and-drop image upload
   - Responsive table for invoice items
   - Modal for displaying invoice preview
   - Sortable and filterable list of generated invoices

The frontend will provide an intuitive interface for users to create invoices, preview them in real-time, and manage previously generated invoices. It will communicate with the backend via API calls to handle data processing and storage.
