Here's a design for the video album app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
Backend Design (Python Flask server):

1. Database:
   - Use SQLite for simplicity
   - Table: videos
     - id (primary key)
     - youtube_id (string)
     - title (string)
     - description (text)
     - tags (string, comma-separated)
     - added_date (datetime)

2. Routes:
   - GET /: Serve the main HTML page
   - GET /videos: Return all videos in JSON format
   - POST /videos: Add a new video to the collection
   - DELETE /videos/<id>: Remove a video from the collection
   - GET /videos/search: Search videos by title or tags

3. Functions:
   - fetch_video_info(youtube_id): Use YouTube Data API to fetch video title and description
   - parse_tags(description): Extract potential tags from video description

4. Dependencies:
   - Flask
   - SQLite3
   - requests (for YouTube API calls)

5. Configuration:
   - YouTube Data API key (for fetching video information)

The server will handle CRUD operations for the video collection, including fetching video information from YouTube and managing tags.

      - "Add Video" button
   
   b. Search and Filter:
      - Search input for title/tag search
      - Tag cloud for quick filtering

   d. Video Player Modal:
