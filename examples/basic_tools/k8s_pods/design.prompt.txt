You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
create an console that use `kubectl` to list all current k8s nodes and pods.
Let me have buttons to `ssh`, `kill` or `view detial` to these pods and nodes.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's my design for the Kubernetes management console app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server that interfaces with kubectl and provides API endpoints:

1. GET /nodes - List all K8s nodes
   - Uses subprocess to run "kubectl get nodes"
   - Returns JSON list of node info

2. GET /pods - List all K8s pods
   - Uses subprocess to run "kubectl get pods --all-namespaces" 
   - Returns JSON list of pod info

3. POST /ssh
   - Accepts node/pod name and command
   - Uses paramiko library to SSH and execute command
   - Returns command output

4. POST /kill
   - Accepts pod name
   - Uses subprocess to run "kubectl delete pod <name>"
   - Returns success/failure status

5. GET /details/<resource_type>/<name>
   - Uses subprocess to run "kubectl describe <resource_type> <name>"
   - Returns formatted details as text

The server will use error handling and input validation to ensure security. It will require authentication to access the API endpoints.

Key Python libraries:
- Flask for web server
- subprocess for running kubectl commands
- paramiko for SSH functionality
- json for parsing kubectl output
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with JavaScript for dynamic updates:

1. Header with title "Kubernetes Management Console"

2. Two main sections: Nodes and Pods

3. Each section has:
   - A table listing resources (nodes/pods)
   - Columns: Name, Status, IP, Actions
   - Action buttons for each row: SSH, Kill, View Details

4. Modal dialogs for:
   - SSH: Command input and output display
   - Kill confirmation
   - Resource details view

5. Refresh button to update node/pod lists

6. Search/filter functionality for both tables

7. Responsive design for mobile/desktop

JavaScript functionality:
- Fetch data from backend API endpoints
- Populate and update tables dynamically
- Handle button clicks and modal interactions
- Implement search/filter for tables

CSS styling:
- Clean, modern look with a dark theme
- Responsive grid layout
- Styled tables and buttons
- Smooth transitions for modals

The page will use vanilla JavaScript for simplicity, with the option to later refactor to a framework like Vue.js if needed for scalability.
