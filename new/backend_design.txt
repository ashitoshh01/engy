Python Flask server:

1. Set up Flask app
2. Define route for calculator operations:
   @app.route('/calculate', methods=['POST'])
   def calculate():
       # Get operation and numbers from request
       # Perform calculation based on operation
       # Return result as JSON

3. Implement calculation functions:
   - add(a, b)
   - subtract(a, b)
   - multiply(a, b)
   - divide(a, b)

4. Error handling:
   - Check for invalid operations
   - Handle division by zero

5. Run Flask app
