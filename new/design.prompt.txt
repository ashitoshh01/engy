You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software architecture.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend).
You only write the design doc with high-level structure and psudocode, no need to write actual code.  

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

# The problem to solve:
<PROBLEM>
create a calculator.
</PROBLEM>

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a high-level design for a calculator app with a Python backend and HTML/JavaScript frontend:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
Python Flask server:

1. Set up Flask app
2. Define route for calculator operations:
   @app.route('/calculate', methods=['POST'])
   def calculate():
       # Get operation and numbers from request
       # Perform calculation based on operation
       # Return result as JSON

3. Implement calculation functions:
   - add(a, b)
   - subtract(a, b)
   - multiply(a, b)
   - divide(a, b)

4. Error handling:
   - Check for invalid operations
   - Handle division by zero

5. Run Flask app
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
Single HTML page with embedded JavaScript:

1. HTML structure:
   - Calculator display
   - Number buttons (0-9)
   - Operation buttons (+, -, *, /)
   - Equals button (=)
   - Clear button (C)

2. CSS styling:
   - Grid layout for calculator buttons
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

3. JavaScript functions:
   - updateDisplay(): Update calculator display
   - appendNumber(number): Add number to current input
   - setOperation(op): Set current operation
   - clearCalculator(): Reset calculator state
   - calculateResult(): Send calculation request to backend

4. AJAX request to backend:
   - Use fetch() to send POST request to /calculate endpoint
   - Send operation and numbers as JSON
   - Update display with result from backend

5. Event listeners:
   - Add click events for all buttons
   - Add keyboard support for numbers and operations

6. Error handling:
   - Display error messages from backend
   - Handle network errors
