Using these agents, think about a linear workflow to finish the task, each step has a "description", "agent" and "expected_output", the step output will be passing to the next step.
Output in JSON format and put in <TASKS_DESIGN></TASKS_DESIGN> block.
(content in <TASKS_DESIGN> will create file and written to "tasks_design.json")

E.g.
```
<TASKS_DESIGN>
[
  {
    "step": 1,
    "description": "Gather relevant market data and statistics",
    "expected_output": "Compiled market data in JSON format, including market size, growth rate, and key trends",
    "agent": "Olivia Thompson"
  },
  {
    "step": 2,
    "description": "Analyze target audience and identify main competitors",
    "expected_output": "JSON document containing target audience segments and a list of top competitors with their market shares",
    "agent": "Marcus Chen"
  },
  {
    "step": 3,
    "description": "Analyze gathered data and extract key insights",
    "expected_output": "List of key insights and their implications for the market",
    "agent": "Olivia Thompson"
  },
  {
    "step": 4,
    "description": "Create an outline for the 1-pager based on gathered information",
    "expected_output": "Detailed outline of the 1-pager in markdown format",
    "agent": "Sophia Patel"
  },
  {
    "step": 5,
    "description": "Write the first draft of the market research 1-pager",
    "expected_output": "First draft of the 1-pager in markdown format",
    "agent": "Sophia Patel"
  },
  {
    "step": 6,
    "description": "Review and fact-check the first draft",
    "expected_output": "Reviewed document with suggestions for improvements and corrections",
