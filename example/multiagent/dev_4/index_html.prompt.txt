You are an expert in Web development, including CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, Node.JS and Hugo / Markdown. You are expert at selecting and choosing the best tools, and doing your utmost to avoid unnecessary duplication and complexity.
When making a suggestion, you break things down in to discrete changes, and suggest a small test after each stage to make sure things are on the right track.
Produce code to illustrate examples, or when directed to in the conversation. If you can answer without code, that is preferred, and you will be asked to elaborate if it is required.
Before writing or suggesting code, you conduct a deep-dive review of the existing code and describe how it works between <CODE_REVIEW> tags. Once you have completed the review, you produce a careful plan for the change in <PLANNING> tags. Pay attention to variable names and string literals - when reproducing code make sure that these do not change unless necessary or directed. If naming something by convention surround in double colons and in ::UPPERCASE::.
Finally, you produce correct outputs that provide the right balance between solving the immediate problem and remaining generic and flexible.
You always ask for clarifications if anything is unclear or ambiguous. You stop to discuss trade-offs and implementation options if there are choices to make.
It is important that you follow this approach, and do your best to teach your interlocutor about making effective decisions. You avoid apologising unnecessarily, and review the conversation to never repeat earlier mistakes.
You are keenly aware of security, and make sure at every step that we don't do anything that could compromise data or introduce new vulnerabilities. Whenever there is a potential security risk (e.g. input handling, authentication management) you will do an additional review, showing your reasoning between <SECURITY_REVIEW> tags.
Finally, it is important that everything produced is operationally sound. We consider how to host, manage, monitor and maintain our solutions. You consider operational concerns at every step, and highlight them where they are relevant.
Bonus: if you can use 3djs or WebGL anywhere need a render or dashboard, use it.

Agents: Competitor analysis

The agent automates the collection, analysis, and reporting of competitor data, enabling marketing professionals to make informed strategic decisions.

### Objectives

- Streamline the competitor analysis process reduce time and effort by automating data collection and analysis.
- Provide actionable insights to marketing teams to enhance strategic planning and positioning. Allow data export through tool integration

### Key Features

1. **Automated Data Collection**
    - **Web Scraping**: The agent autonomously scrapes competitor websites for relevant information, including product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
    - **Social Media**: Check competitors' social media account to gather data on followership, activities，including Linkedin, Youtube, Tiktok, Pinterest, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, Discord
    - **News and Press Release Aggregation**: Collects and analyzes news articles and press releases related to competitors to stay updated on their latest developments.
    - **Customer reviews**: Collect relevant customer reviews and analyze sentiment related to product features and services from Trustpilot, G2, Google, Yelp, and more ([Smelter AI](https://youtu.be/LqjpZS73Ewo?si=zcW7e3di_8bht-u2)).
2. **Analysis and insight reporting**
    
    Generate a report that includes that following:
    
    - **Trend Analysis**: Synthesize publicly available data sources, such as industry reports, market research studies, and government publications that provide valuable information about market trends, industry benchmarks, and customer behavior. Identify emerging trends, new technologies, and innovative approaches to help users stay relevant and maintain a competitive edge.
    - **SWOT Analysis**: Conducts automated SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis based on the collected data.
        - S - Identify what your competitors are doing well and what works for them. Do reviews indicate they have a superior product? Do they have high brand awareness? Can you test a competitor’s products yourself to see where they are performing better?
        - W - Identify what each competitor could be doing better to give you a competitive advantage. Do they have a weak social media strategy? Do they have just an online store, not a brick-and-mortar one? Is their website outdated?
        - O - Opportunities are factors that might work in favor of a business. What trends can provoke growths in the industry? What audience can also be targeted?
        - T - Define what can potentially harm your competitors’ businesses. This might include politics, new regulations or changing customer preferences.
    - **Competitive Benchmarking**: Compares key performance indicators (KPIs) of competitors against industry standards and the organization's metrics.
    - **Price comparison**: Look up the data from the website pricing section or marketplaces. For eCommerce products, check price point across a variety of marketplaces
    - **Generate Unique Selling Point**: <a competitor> is confident that customers will buy <a competitor>’s product because <a competitor> solves <a customer problem> better than any alternative due to the following reasons: A B C D E ([Not generic - PMM])

1. Problem Summary

The problem requires designing a multi-agent system to automate competitor analysis for marketing professionals. The system needs to collect data from various sources, analyze it, and generate comprehensive reports with actionable insights. Key features include automated data collection from websites, social media, news sources, and customer reviews; analysis and insight reporting including trend analysis, SWOT analysis, competitive benchmarking, price comparison, and generating unique selling points.

2. Proposed Multi-Agent System

To address this complex task, I propose a system with four specialized agents:

a) Data Collection Agent
b) Analysis and Insights Agent
c) Report Generation Agent
d) Quality Assurance and Integration Agent

3. Expected Solution Process

1. The Data Collection Agent gathers information from various sources.
2. The Analysis and Insights Agent processes the collected data to extract meaningful insights.
3. The Report Generation Agent compiles the analyzed information into a comprehensive report.
4. The Quality Assurance and Integration Agent reviews the report, ensures accuracy, and prepares it for export to various tools.

4. Final Agent Design JSON

</AGENTS_DESIGN>

This multi-agent system is designed to efficiently handle the competitor analysis task while ensuring accuracy, comprehensiveness, and actionability of the final report. The system is scalable to accommodate additional data sources or analysis techniques, adaptable to various industries and competitor types, and includes error handling mechanisms through the Quality Assurance agent. 

The workflow allows for iterative improvements, as the Quality Assurance agent can potentially feed back to the Report Generation agent for revisions if needed. The system also considers ethical implications by focusing on publicly available data and avoiding any unethical data collection practices.

To further enhance the system, we could consider adding a user interface agent to facilitate interaction with marketing professionals, allowing them to customize report parameters or request specific analyses. Additionally, a machine learning agent could be incorporated to improve trend detection and predictive analytics over time.

Now implement a python backend server "server.py" as a DAG server that control and monitor the multi-agent executions by exposing REST APIs (websocket).
1. API to control agent executions (individual agent).
2. websocket to subscribe execution status.
3. websocket to receive execution results.
4. API to get all agents metadata, e.g. name, send_to, receive_from.
5. serve "index.html" in the same directory.

```python
@app.route('/')
def serve_index():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'index.html')
```

=== 3: assistant ===
Certainly! I'll create a Python backend server using Flask and Flask-SocketIO to implement the DAG server that controls and monitors the multi-agent executions. Here's the implementation:

<SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>
import os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit
from flask_cors import CORS
from agents import all_agents
import threading
import json

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

# Store execution status and results
execution_status = {}
execution_results = {}

def execute_agent(agent_name):
    agent = next((a for a in all_agents if a.name == agent_name), None)
    if agent:
        execution_status[agent_name] = "Running"
        socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': "Running"})
        
        try:
            result = agent.execute()
            execution_results[agent_name] = result
            execution_status[agent_name] = "Completed"
            socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': "Completed"})
            socketio.emit('execution_result', {'agent': agent_name, 'result': result})
        except Exception as e:
            execution_status[agent_name] = f"Error: {str(e)}"
            socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': f"Error: {str(e)}"})
    else:
        socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': "Agent not found"})

@app.route('/api/execute/<agent_name>', methods=['POST'])
def execute_agent_api(agent_name):
    threading.Thread(target=execute_agent, args=(agent_name,)).start()
    return jsonify({"message": f"Execution of {agent_name} started"}), 202

@app.route('/api/agents', methods=['GET'])
def get_agents_metadata():
    agents_metadata = []
    for agent in all_agents:
        agents_metadata.append({
            "name": agent.name,
            "role": agent.role,
            "send_to": agent.send_to,
            "receive_from": agent.receive_from
        })
    return jsonify(agents_metadata)

@app.route('/')
def serve_index():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'index.html')

@socketio.on('connect')
def handle_connect():
    print('Client connected')

@socketio.on('disconnect')
def handle_disconnect():
    print('Client disconnected')

@socketio.on('subscribe_status')
def handle_subscribe_status():
    for agent_name, status in execution_status.items():
        emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': status})

@socketio.on('subscribe_results')
def handle_subscribe_results():
    for agent_name, result in execution_results.items():
        emit('execution_result', {'agent': agent_name, 'result': result})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, host='localhost', port=8314, debug=True)
</SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>

This server implements the following features:

1. API to control agent executions (individual agent):
   - POST `/api/execute/<agent_name>` starts the execution of a specific agent.

2. WebSocket to subscribe to execution status:
   - Connect to the WebSocket and emit 'subscribe_status' to receive status updates.

3. WebSocket to receive execution results:
   - Connect to the WebSocket and emit 'subscribe_results' to receive execution results.

4. API to get all agents metadata:
   - GET `/api/agents` returns metadata for all agents.

5. Serve "index.html" in the same directory:
   - The root route '/' serves the index.html file.

To use this server:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```
   pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors
   ```

2. Save the code above as `server.py` in the same directory as your `agents.py` file.

3. Create an `index.html` file in the same directory (you'll need to implement the frontend separately).

4. Run the server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```

The server will start on `localhost:8314`. You can now interact with it using HTTP requests and WebSocket connections. The frontend can connect to the WebSocket to receive real-time updates on agent execution status and results.

Note: This implementation assumes that the `Agent` class in `agents.py` has an `execute()` method that returns the expected output as a string. If the actual implementation is different, you may need to adjust the `execute_agent` function accordingly.
=== 4: user ===
Generate "index.html" that connect to the server.

Frontend should have drag-and-drop style UX to view the DAG/workflow.
The node of workflow is `agent`.
The node should connect to each other based on `send_to`, `receive_from`.

Certainly! I'll create an `index.html` file that connects to the server and provides a drag-and-drop style UX to view the DAG/workflow. We'll use D3.js for the graph visualization and interact with the WebSocket server.

Here's the `index.html` file:

This `index.html` file creates a drag-and-drop style UX to view the DAG/workflow. Here's a breakdown of its features:

1. The page is divided into two sections: the graph visualization on the left and a sidebar on the right.

2. The graph is created using D3.js, with nodes representing agents and links representing the connections between them based on `send_to` and `receive_from` relationships.

3. Agents are represented as circles with their names, and you can drag them around the graph.

4. Clicking on an agent node will trigger its execution on the server.

5. The sidebar displays real-time status updates and execution results for each agent.

6. The page connects to the WebSocket server to receive live updates on agent status and execution results.

To use this frontend:

1. Save the code above as `index.html` in the same directory as your `server.py` file.

2. Make sure your server is running (`python server.py`).

3. Open `http://localhost:8314` in your web browser.

You should now see a visual representation of your agent workflow, with the ability to interact with the agents, view their status, and see their execution results in real-time.
