You are an expert in Web development, including CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, Node.JS and Hugo / Markdown. You are expert at selecting and choosing the best tools, and doing your utmost to avoid unnecessary duplication and complexity.
When making a suggestion, you break things down in to discrete changes, and suggest a small test after each stage to make sure things are on the right track.
Produce code to illustrate examples, or when directed to in the conversation. If you can answer without code, that is preferred, and you will be asked to elaborate if it is required.
Before writing or suggesting code, you conduct a deep-dive review of the existing code and describe how it works between <CODE_REVIEW> tags. Once you have completed the review, you produce a careful plan for the change in <PLANNING> tags. Pay attention to variable names and string literals - when reproducing code make sure that these do not change unless necessary or directed. If naming something by convention surround in double colons and in ::UPPERCASE::.
Finally, you produce correct outputs that provide the right balance between solving the immediate problem and remaining generic and flexible.
You always ask for clarifications if anything is unclear or ambiguous. You stop to discuss trade-offs and implementation options if there are choices to make.
It is important that you follow this approach, and do your best to teach your interlocutor about making effective decisions. You avoid apologising unnecessarily, and review the conversation to never repeat earlier mistakes.
You are keenly aware of security, and make sure at every step that we don't do anything that could compromise data or introduce new vulnerabilities. Whenever there is a potential security risk (e.g. input handling, authentication management) you will do an additional review, showing your reasoning between <SECURITY_REVIEW> tags.
Finally, it is important that everything produced is operationally sound. We consider how to host, manage, monitor and maintain our solutions. You consider operational concerns at every step, and highlight them where they are relevant.
Bonus: if you can use 3djs or WebGL anywhere need a render or dashboard, use it.

<PROBLEM>
Agents: advanced competitor data collection.

1. **Automated Data Collection**
    - **Web Scraping**: The agent autonomously scrapes competitor websites for relevant information, including product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
    - **Social Media**: Check competitors' social media account to gather data on followership, activitiesï¼Œincluding Linkedin, Youtube, Tiktok, Pinterest, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, Discord
    - **News and Press Release Aggregation**: Collects and analyzes news articles and press releases related to competitors to stay updated on their latest developments.
    - **Customer reviews**: Collect relevant customer reviews and analyze sentiment related to product features and services from Trustpilot, G2, Google, Yelp, and more ([Smelter AI](https://youtu.be/LqjpZS73Ewo?si=zcW7e3di_8bht-u2)).

</PROBLEM>

=== 1: assistant ===
Certainly! I'll design a multi-agent system to address the advanced competitor data collection problem. Let's break this down step by step.

1. Problem Summary:
The task is to create an advanced competitor data collection system using multiple agents. This system needs to autonomously gather data from various sources, including websites, social media platforms, news outlets, and customer review sites. The collected data should provide comprehensive insights into competitors' strategies, offerings, and market presence.

2. Proposed Multi-Agent System:

For this problem, I propose a system with four specialized agents:

a) Web Scraper Agent
b) Social Media Analyzer Agent
c) News and PR Aggregator Agent
d) Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent

These agents will work together to collect and analyze competitor data from different sources, providing a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape.

Interaction Diagram:
```
Web Scraper Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
Social Media Analyzer Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
News and PR Aggregator Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
```

Workflow Description:
1. All four specialized agents (Web Scraper, Social Media Analyzer, News and PR Aggregator, and Review Sentiment Analyzer) work concurrently to collect data from their respective sources.
2. Each agent processes and analyzes the data within its domain of expertise.
3. The processed data from each agent is sent to the Data Integration Agent.
4. The Data Integration Agent combines all the information, removes duplicates, and creates a comprehensive competitor analysis report.
5. The final report is reviewed for quality and completeness before being presented to the user.

3. Expected Solution Process:
1. The system is initialized with a list of competitors to analyze.
2. Each specialized agent begins its data collection and analysis tasks simultaneously.
3. The Web Scraper Agent collects data from competitor websites, focusing on product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
4. The Social Media Analyzer Agent gathers data from various social media platforms, analyzing follower counts, engagement rates, and content strategies.
5. The News and PR Aggregator Agent collects recent news articles and press releases related to the competitors.
6. The Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent collects customer reviews from various platforms and performs sentiment analysis.
7. As each agent completes its analysis, it sends the processed data to the Data Integration Agent.
8. The Data Integration Agent combines all the data, ensuring no duplication and creating a cohesive narrative.
9. The final comprehensive report is generated, providing insights into competitors' strategies, market presence, and customer perception.

4. Final Agent Design JSON:

</AGENTS_DESIGN>

This multi-agent system is designed to provide a comprehensive and automated approach to competitor data collection and analysis. Here are some additional considerations:

1. Scalability: The system can easily scale by adding more instances of each agent type to handle a larger number of competitors or more frequent updates.

2. Adaptability: The modular design allows for easy addition of new data sources or analysis techniques by creating new specialized agents.

3. Error Handling: Each agent should have built-in error handling mechanisms, such as retrying failed requests or flagging inconsistent data for human review.

4. Ethical Considerations: The system is designed to respect privacy and terms of service of various platforms. The Web Scraper Agent, in particular, adheres to ethical scraping guidelines to avoid overloading target websites.

This system provides a robust framework for advanced competitor data collection, offering insights from various sources to create a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape.

```

Now implement a python backend server "server.py" as a DAG server that control and monitor the multi-agent executions by exposing REST APIs (websocket).
1. API to control agent executions (individual agent).
2. websocket to subscribe execution status.
3. websocket to receive execution results.
4. API to get all agents metadata, e.g. name, role, goal, backstory, task_description, send_to, receive_from.
5. serve "index.html" in the same directory.

```python
@app.route('/')
def serve_index():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'index.html')
```

=== 3: assistant ===
Certainly! I'll create a Python backend server using Flask and Flask-SocketIO to implement the DAG server that controls and monitors the multi-agent executions. Here's the implementation of the "server.py" file:

<SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>
import os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit
from flask_cors import CORS
from agents import all_agents
import threading
import json

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

# Store execution status and results
execution_status = {}
execution_results = {}

def agent_executor(agent_name):
    agent = next((a for a in all_agents if a.name == agent_name), None)
    if agent:
        execution_status[agent_name] = "Running"
        socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': "Running"})
        
        try:
            result = agent.execute()
            execution_results[agent_name] = result
            execution_status[agent_name] = "Completed"
            socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': "Completed"})
            socketio.emit('execution_result', {'agent': agent_name, 'result': result})
        except Exception as e:
            execution_status[agent_name] = f"Error: {str(e)}"
            socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': f"Error: {str(e)}"})

@app.route('/api/agents', methods=['GET'])
def get_agents():
    agents_data = []
    for agent in all_agents:
        agents_data.append({
            'name': agent.name,
            'role': agent.role,
            'goal': agent.goal,
            'backstory': agent.backstory,
            'task_description': agent.task_description,
            'send_to': agent.send_to,
            'receive_from': agent.receive_from
        })
    return jsonify(agents_data)

@app.route('/api/execute/<agent_name>', methods=['POST'])
def execute_agent(agent_name):
    agent = next((a for a in all_agents if a.name == agent_name), None)
    if agent:
        threading.Thread(target=agent_executor, args=(agent_name,)).start()
        return jsonify({"message": f"Execution started for agent: {agent_name}"}), 202
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": f"Agent not found: {agent_name}"}), 404

@socketio.on('connect')
def handle_connect():
    print('Client connected')

@socketio.on('disconnect')
def handle_disconnect():
    print('Client disconnected')

@socketio.on('subscribe_status')
def handle_subscribe_status():
    for agent_name, status in execution_status.items():
        emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': status})

@socketio.on('subscribe_results')
def handle_subscribe_results():
    for agent_name, result in execution_results.items():
        emit('execution_result', {'agent': agent_name, 'result': result})

@app.route('/')
def serve_index():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, host='localhost', port=6092, debug=True)
</SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>

This server implementation provides the following functionality:

1. API to control agent executions (individual agent):
   - `POST /api/execute/<agent_name>`: Starts the execution of a specific agent.

2. WebSocket to subscribe to execution status:
   - Connect to the WebSocket and emit a 'subscribe_status' event to receive status updates.

3. WebSocket to receive execution results:
   - Connect to the WebSocket and emit a 'subscribe_results' event to receive execution results.

4. API to get all agents metadata:
   - `GET /api/agents`: Returns metadata for all agents.

5. Serving "index.html":
   - The root route ('/') serves the index.html file from the current directory.

To use this server:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```
   pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors
   ```

2. Save the code above as "server.py" in the same directory as your "agents.py" file.

3. Create an "index.html" file in the same directory (you'll need to implement this separately).

4. Run the server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```

The server will start on `localhost:6092`. You can now interact with it using HTTP requests and WebSocket connections. The server uses threading to handle agent executions asynchronously, allowing for multiple agents to run concurrently without blocking the main thread.

Remember to implement proper error handling and security measures if you plan to use this in a production environment.
=== 4: user ===
Generate "index.html" that connect to the server.

1. Frontend should have drag-and-drop style UX to view the DAG/workflow. The node of workflow is `agent`. The node should connect to each other based on `send_to`, `receive_from`. The connection should be directional.
2. When click an agent (node), show its metadata.
3. The exection results should be shown in markdown, and collapsed by default. View execution results in pretty json.
4. When an agent execution result is received, auto-trigger downstream (send_to) agent executions.
5. Add an input component to let user input text and feed to the first agent, side by a "start" button to execute from the first agent (the agent with empty receive_from).

=== 5: assistant ===
Certainly! I'll create an "index.html" file that connects to the server and implements the requested features. We'll use Vue.js for reactivity, Axios for HTTP requests, and jsPlumb for the drag-and-drop workflow visualization. We'll also use Tailwind CSS for styling and marked.js for rendering Markdown.

This HTML file implements the requested features:

1. Drag-and-drop style UX for viewing the DAG/workflow:
   - The workflow is visualized using jsPlumb, with agents as nodes and connections based on `send_to` and `receive_from`.
   - Nodes are draggable within the workflow area.

2. Clicking an agent (node) shows its metadata:
   - When a node is clicked, the agent's metadata is displayed below the workflow.

3. Execution results are shown in Markdown and collapsed by default:
   - Results are displayed for each agent, with a toggle button to expand/collapse.
   - Markdown is rendered using marked.js.
   - JSON results are also displayed in a pretty-printed format.

4. Auto-triggering downstream agent executions:
   - When an execution result is received, the `triggerDownstreamAgents` method is called to execute the next agents in the workflow.

5. Input component for the first agent:
   - An input field and "Start Workflow" button are provided at the top of the page.
   - The `startWorkflow` method finds the first agent (with empty `receive_from`) and starts the execution.

To use this file:

1. Save it as "index.html" in the same directory as your "server.py" file.
2. Make sure your server is running (`python server.py`).
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser or access it through `http://localhost:6092`.

This implementation provides a basic interface for interacting with your multi-agent system. You may want to further improve the styling and add more error handling for a production environment.

Stylize and make "index.html" beatuful, look production-ready, by using pure CSS website framework "Tailwind CSS".

Certainly! I'll revamp the "index.html" file using Tailwind CSS to create a more beautiful and production-ready look. We'll use a modern, clean design with a responsive layout.

Here's the updated "index.html" file:

This updated version of the "index.html" file incorporates Tailwind CSS to create a more polished and production-ready look. Here are the key improvements:

1. Modern, clean design: The overall layout now follows a more professional design with a navigation bar, header, and well-structured content areas.

2. Responsive layout: The design is responsive and should look good on various screen sizes.

3. Improved workflow visualization: The agent nodes in the workflow are now styled with a clean, card-like appearance and smooth hover effects.

4. Better readability: The agent details and execution results are presented in a more organized and easy-to-read format.

5. Consistent color scheme: The design uses a cohesive color palette based on Tailwind's default theme, which can be easily customized if needed.

6. Enhanced user input area: The input field for the first agent now has a more prominent design with a connected button.

7. Collapsible results: The execution results for each agent are now in collapsible sections, allowing for a cleaner overall view.

8. Code highlighting: The JSON results are displayed in a pre-formatted block with a light background for better readability.

This updated design maintains all the functionality of the previous version while providing a more professional and visually appealing user interface. The use of Tailwind CSS allows for easy customization and ensures a consistent design language throughout the application.

To use this updated file:

1. Replace your existing "index.html" file with this new version.
2. Make sure your server is running (`python server.py`).
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser or access it through `http://localhost:6092`.

The result should be a much more polished and user-friendly interface for your multi-agent workflow system.
