You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in backend development.
You are good at writing python webserver in single self-contained python files.

1. Regarding data or database.
If provide API key and mention API to use, generate client to actually connect to the API. (assume API is accesible and key is correct.)
Otherwise, generate mock data and prefer to use in-memory data-structure database.
When use sqlite, use local file database (in current directory).

2. You may use libraries like Flask, websocket and etc.
When use Flask, also enable CORS.

3. Bind to `localhost:6092`.

Output python source code should be included in <SERVER_PYTHON_CODE></SERVER_PYTHON_CODE> block.

<PROBLEM>
Agents: advanced competitor data collection.

1. **Automated Data Collection**
    - **Web Scraping**: The agent autonomously scrapes competitor websites for relevant information, including product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
    - **Social Media**: Check competitors' social media account to gather data on followership, activitiesï¼Œincluding Linkedin, Youtube, Tiktok, Pinterest, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, Discord
    - **News and Press Release Aggregation**: Collects and analyzes news articles and press releases related to competitors to stay updated on their latest developments.
    - **Customer reviews**: Collect relevant customer reviews and analyze sentiment related to product features and services from Trustpilot, G2, Google, Yelp, and more ([Smelter AI](https://youtu.be/LqjpZS73Ewo?si=zcW7e3di_8bht-u2)).

</PROBLEM>

=== 1: assistant ===
Certainly! I'll design a multi-agent system to address the advanced competitor data collection problem. Let's break this down step by step.

1. Problem Summary:
The task is to create an advanced competitor data collection system using multiple agents. This system needs to autonomously gather data from various sources, including websites, social media platforms, news outlets, and customer review sites. The collected data should provide comprehensive insights into competitors' strategies, offerings, and market presence.

2. Proposed Multi-Agent System:

For this problem, I propose a system with four specialized agents:

a) Web Scraper Agent
b) Social Media Analyzer Agent
c) News and PR Aggregator Agent
d) Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent

These agents will work together to collect and analyze competitor data from different sources, providing a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape.

Interaction Diagram:
```
Web Scraper Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
Social Media Analyzer Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
News and PR Aggregator Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
```

Workflow Description:
1. All four specialized agents (Web Scraper, Social Media Analyzer, News and PR Aggregator, and Review Sentiment Analyzer) work concurrently to collect data from their respective sources.
2. Each agent processes and analyzes the data within its domain of expertise.
3. The processed data from each agent is sent to the Data Integration Agent.
4. The Data Integration Agent combines all the information, removes duplicates, and creates a comprehensive competitor analysis report.
5. The final report is reviewed for quality and completeness before being presented to the user.

3. Expected Solution Process:
1. The system is initialized with a list of competitors to analyze.
2. Each specialized agent begins its data collection and analysis tasks simultaneously.
3. The Web Scraper Agent collects data from competitor websites, focusing on product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
4. The Social Media Analyzer Agent gathers data from various social media platforms, analyzing follower counts, engagement rates, and content strategies.
5. The News and PR Aggregator Agent collects recent news articles and press releases related to the competitors.
6. The Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent collects customer reviews from various platforms and performs sentiment analysis.
7. As each agent completes its analysis, it sends the processed data to the Data Integration Agent.
8. The Data Integration Agent combines all the data, ensuring no duplication and creating a cohesive narrative.
9. The final comprehensive report is generated, providing insights into competitors' strategies, market presence, and customer perception.

4. Final Agent Design JSON:

This multi-agent system is designed to provide a comprehensive and automated approach to competitor data collection and analysis. Here are some additional considerations:

1. Scalability: The system can easily scale by adding more instances of each agent type to handle a larger number of competitors or more frequent updates.

2. Adaptability: The modular design allows for easy addition of new data sources or analysis techniques by creating new specialized agents.

3. Error Handling: Each agent should have built-in error handling mechanisms, such as retrying failed requests or flagging inconsistent data for human review.

4. Ethical Considerations: The system is designed to respect privacy and terms of service of various platforms. The Web Scraper Agent, in particular, adheres to ethical scraping guidelines to avoid overloading target websites.

This system provides a robust framework for advanced competitor data collection, offering insights from various sources to create a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape.

Now implement a python backend server "server.py" as a DAG server that control and monitor the multi-agent executions by exposing REST APIs (websocket).
1. API to control agent executions (individual agent).
2. websocket to subscribe execution status.
3. websocket to receive execution results.
4. API to get all agents metadata, e.g. name, role, goal, backstory, task_description, send_to, receive_from.
5. serve "index.html" in the same directory.

```python
@app.route('/')
def serve_index():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'index.html')
```

Certainly! I'll create a Python backend server using Flask and Flask-SocketIO to implement the DAG server that controls and monitors the multi-agent executions. Here's the implementation of the "server.py" file:

<SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>
import os
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit
from flask_cors import CORS
from agents import all_agents
import threading
import json

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

# Store execution status and results
execution_status = {}
execution_results = {}

def agent_executor(agent_name):
    agent = next((a for a in all_agents if a.name == agent_name), None)
    if agent:
        execution_status[agent_name] = "Running"
        socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': "Running"})
        
        try:
            result = agent.execute()
            execution_results[agent_name] = result
            execution_status[agent_name] = "Completed"
            socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': "Completed"})
            socketio.emit('execution_result', {'agent': agent_name, 'result': result})
        except Exception as e:
            execution_status[agent_name] = f"Error: {str(e)}"
            socketio.emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': f"Error: {str(e)}"})

@app.route('/api/agents', methods=['GET'])
def get_agents():
    agents_data = []
    for agent in all_agents:
        agents_data.append({
            'name': agent.name,
            'role': agent.role,
            'goal': agent.goal,
            'backstory': agent.backstory,
            'task_description': agent.task_description,
            'send_to': agent.send_to,
            'receive_from': agent.receive_from
        })
    return jsonify(agents_data)

@app.route('/api/execute/<agent_name>', methods=['POST'])
def execute_agent(agent_name):
    agent = next((a for a in all_agents if a.name == agent_name), None)
    if agent:
        threading.Thread(target=agent_executor, args=(agent_name,)).start()
        return jsonify({"message": f"Execution started for agent: {agent_name}"}), 202
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": f"Agent not found: {agent_name}"}), 404

@socketio.on('connect')
def handle_connect():
    print('Client connected')

@socketio.on('disconnect')
def handle_disconnect():
    print('Client disconnected')

@socketio.on('subscribe_status')
def handle_subscribe_status():
    for agent_name, status in execution_status.items():
        emit('status_update', {'agent': agent_name, 'status': status})

@socketio.on('subscribe_results')
def handle_subscribe_results():
    for agent_name, result in execution_results.items():
        emit('execution_result', {'agent': agent_name, 'result': result})

@app.route('/')
def serve_index():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, host='localhost', port=6092, debug=True)
</SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>

This server implementation provides the following functionality:

1. API to control agent executions (individual agent):
   - `POST /api/execute/<agent_name>`: Starts the execution of a specific agent.

2. WebSocket to subscribe to execution status:
   - Connect to the WebSocket and emit a 'subscribe_status' event to receive status updates.

3. WebSocket to receive execution results:
   - Connect to the WebSocket and emit a 'subscribe_results' event to receive execution results.

4. API to get all agents metadata:
   - `GET /api/agents`: Returns metadata for all agents.

5. Serving "index.html":
   - The root route ('/') serves the index.html file from the current directory.

To use this server:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```
   pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors
   ```

2. Save the code above as "server.py" in the same directory as your "agents.py" file.

3. Create an "index.html" file in the same directory (you'll need to implement this separately).

4. Run the server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```

The server will start on `localhost:6092`. You can now interact with it using HTTP requests and WebSocket connections. The server uses threading to handle agent executions asynchronously, allowing for multiple agents to run concurrently without blocking the main thread.

Remember to implement proper error handling and security measures if you plan to use this in a production environment.
