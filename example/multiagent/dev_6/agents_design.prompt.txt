# Multi-Agent System Design and Orchestration

You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in multi-agent system design and orchestration. Your task is to analyze problems presented in the <PROBLEM></PROBLEM> block and design a multi-agent system to address them comprehensively.

## System Design Steps:

1. Problem Analysis:
   - Carefully read and analyze the problem statement.
   - Identify key requirements, constraints, and objectives.

2. Agent Identification:
   - Determine the necessary agent types (2-5 agents) based on the problem's needs.
   - Define each agent's primary role and responsibilities.

3. Agent Interaction Design:
   - Establish communication protocols between agents.
   - Define the types of information or requests agents can exchange.

4. Workflow Design:
   - Create a step-by-step workflow showing how agents collaborate to solve the problem.
   - Identify decision points and potential iterative processes.

5. Output Specification:
   - Define the final output format and content for the solution.
   - Ensure the output addresses all aspects of the original problem.

## Agent Design

For each agent in your system, provide the following information:

1. Name: A human-like name for the agent.
2. Role: The specific function or position of the agent within the system.
3. Goal: The primary objective or purpose of the agent.
4. Backstory: A brief background that explains the agent's expertise and experience.
5. Tools: A list of tools or capabilities the agent has access to.
6. Task Description: A detailed description of the task goal and steps to follow to produce the expected output.
7. Expected Output: A clear description of the format and content the agent should produce.
8. Send_to: A list of agent names to which this agent sends information or requests.
9. Receive_from: A list of agent names from which this agent receives information or requests.

## Agent Interaction Guidelines:

Please brainstorm/simulate agents interactions (as chain-of-thoughts) before writing actual agents design.

- Agents can "talk to" each other by sending structured messages.
- Example: Websearch Agent → Analysis Agent: "summary on website xxx"
- Analysis Agent → Task Coordinator: "analysis report for website xxx"

## Output Format:

1. Problem Summary
2. Proposed Multi-Agent System:
   - List of agents with roles (using the Agent Design format)
   - Interaction diagram (if applicable)
   - Workflow description
3. Expected Solution Process
4. Final Agent Design JSON in <AGENTS_DESIGN></AGENTS_DESIGN> block. 

## Additional Considerations:

1. Scalability: Consider how the system might scale to handle larger problems or increased workload.
2. Adaptability: Design the system to be flexible enough to handle variations of the given problem.
3. Error Handling: Include mechanisms for dealing with potential failures or unexpected situations.
4. Ethical Considerations: Ensure the system respects privacy, fairness, and other relevant ethical principles.

After designing the system, be prepared to answer questions or make modifications based on user feedback. You may also be asked to simulate the interaction between agents to demonstrate how the system would work in practice.

<PROBLEM>
Agents: advanced competitor data collection.

1. **Automated Data Collection**
    - **Web Scraping**: The agent autonomously scrapes competitor websites for relevant information, including product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
    - **Social Media**: Check competitors' social media account to gather data on followership, activities，including Linkedin, Youtube, Tiktok, Pinterest, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, Discord
    - **News and Press Release Aggregation**: Collects and analyzes news articles and press releases related to competitors to stay updated on their latest developments.
    - **Customer reviews**: Collect relevant customer reviews and analyze sentiment related to product features and services from Trustpilot, G2, Google, Yelp, and more ([Smelter AI](https://youtu.be/LqjpZS73Ewo?si=zcW7e3di_8bht-u2)).

Certainly! I'll design a multi-agent system to address the advanced competitor data collection problem. Let's break this down step by step.

1. Problem Summary:
The task is to create an advanced competitor data collection system using multiple agents. This system needs to autonomously gather data from various sources, including websites, social media platforms, news outlets, and customer review sites. The collected data should provide comprehensive insights into competitors' strategies, offerings, and market presence.

2. Proposed Multi-Agent System:

For this problem, I propose a system with four specialized agents:

a) Web Scraper Agent
b) Social Media Analyzer Agent
c) News and PR Aggregator Agent
d) Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent

These agents will work together to collect and analyze competitor data from different sources, providing a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape.

Interaction Diagram:
```
Web Scraper Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
Social Media Analyzer Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
News and PR Aggregator Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent -----> Data Integration Agent
```

Workflow Description:
1. All four specialized agents (Web Scraper, Social Media Analyzer, News and PR Aggregator, and Review Sentiment Analyzer) work concurrently to collect data from their respective sources.
2. Each agent processes and analyzes the data within its domain of expertise.
3. The processed data from each agent is sent to the Data Integration Agent.
4. The Data Integration Agent combines all the information, removes duplicates, and creates a comprehensive competitor analysis report.
5. The final report is reviewed for quality and completeness before being presented to the user.

3. Expected Solution Process:
1. The system is initialized with a list of competitors to analyze.
2. Each specialized agent begins its data collection and analysis tasks simultaneously.
3. The Web Scraper Agent collects data from competitor websites, focusing on product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
4. The Social Media Analyzer Agent gathers data from various social media platforms, analyzing follower counts, engagement rates, and content strategies.
5. The News and PR Aggregator Agent collects recent news articles and press releases related to the competitors.
6. The Review Sentiment Analyzer Agent collects customer reviews from various platforms and performs sentiment analysis.
7. As each agent completes its analysis, it sends the processed data to the Data Integration Agent.
8. The Data Integration Agent combines all the data, ensuring no duplication and creating a cohesive narrative.
9. The final comprehensive report is generated, providing insights into competitors' strategies, market presence, and customer perception.

This multi-agent system is designed to provide a comprehensive and automated approach to competitor data collection and analysis. Here are some additional considerations:

1. Scalability: The system can easily scale by adding more instances of each agent type to handle a larger number of competitors or more frequent updates.

2. Adaptability: The modular design allows for easy addition of new data sources or analysis techniques by creating new specialized agents.

3. Error Handling: Each agent should have built-in error handling mechanisms, such as retrying failed requests or flagging inconsistent data for human review.

4. Ethical Considerations: The system is designed to respect privacy and terms of service of various platforms. The Web Scraper Agent, in particular, adheres to ethical scraping guidelines to avoid overloading target websites.

This system provides a robust framework for advanced competitor data collection, offering insights from various sources to create a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape.
