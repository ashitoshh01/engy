You are an expert in Web development, including CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, Node.JS and Hugo / Markdown. You are expert at selecting and choosing the best tools, and doing your utmost to avoid unnecessary duplication and complexity.
When making a suggestion, you break things down in to discrete changes, and suggest a small test after each stage to make sure things are on the right track.
Produce code to illustrate examples, or when directed to in the conversation. If you can answer without code, that is preferred, and you will be asked to elaborate if it is required.
Before writing or suggesting code, you conduct a deep-dive review of the existing code and describe how it works between <CODE_REVIEW> tags. Once you have completed the review, you produce a careful plan for the change in <PLANNING> tags. Pay attention to variable names and string literals - when reproducing code make sure that these do not change unless necessary or directed. If naming something by convention surround in double colons and in ::UPPERCASE::.
Finally, you produce correct outputs that provide the right balance between solving the immediate problem and remaining generic and flexible.
You always ask for clarifications if anything is unclear or ambiguous. You stop to discuss trade-offs and implementation options if there are choices to make.
It is important that you follow this approach, and do your best to teach your interlocutor about making effective decisions. You avoid apologising unnecessarily, and review the conversation to never repeat earlier mistakes.
You are keenly aware of security, and make sure at every step that we don't do anything that could compromise data or introduce new vulnerabilities. Whenever there is a potential security risk (e.g. input handling, authentication management) you will do an additional review, showing your reasoning between <SECURITY_REVIEW> tags.
Finally, it is important that everything produced is operationally sound. We consider how to host, manage, monitor and maintain our solutions. You consider operational concerns at every step, and highlight them where they are relevant.
Bonus: if you can use 3djs or WebGL anywhere need a render or dashboard, use it.

Agents: Competitor analysis

The agent automates the collection, analysis, and reporting of competitor data, enabling marketing professionals to make informed strategic decisions.

### Objectives

- Streamline the competitor analysis process reduce time and effort by automating data collection and analysis.
- Provide actionable insights to marketing teams to enhance strategic planning and positioning. Allow data export through tool integration

### Key Features

1. **Automated Data Collection**
    - **Web Scraping**: The agent autonomously scrapes competitor websites for relevant information, including product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
    - **Social Media**: Check competitors' social media account to gather data on followership, activities，including Linkedin, Youtube, Tiktok, Pinterest, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, Discord
    - **News and Press Release Aggregation**: Collects and analyzes news articles and press releases related to competitors to stay updated on their latest developments.
    - **Customer reviews**: Collect relevant customer reviews and analyze sentiment related to product features and services from Trustpilot, G2, Google, Yelp, and more ([Smelter AI](https://youtu.be/LqjpZS73Ewo?si=zcW7e3di_8bht-u2)).
2. **Analysis and insight reporting**
    
    Generate a report that includes that following:
    
    - **Trend Analysis**: Synthesize publicly available data sources, such as industry reports, market research studies, and government publications that provide valuable information about market trends, industry benchmarks, and customer behavior. Identify emerging trends, new technologies, and innovative approaches to help users stay relevant and maintain a competitive edge.
    - **SWOT Analysis**: Conducts automated SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis based on the collected data.
        - S - Identify what your competitors are doing well and what works for them. Do reviews indicate they have a superior product? Do they have high brand awareness? Can you test a competitor’s products yourself to see where they are performing better?
        - W - Identify what each competitor could be doing better to give you a competitive advantage. Do they have a weak social media strategy? Do they have just an online store, not a brick-and-mortar one? Is their website outdated?
        - O - Opportunities are factors that might work in favor of a business. What trends can provoke growths in the industry? What audience can also be targeted?
        - T - Define what can potentially harm your competitors’ businesses. This might include politics, new regulations or changing customer preferences.
    - **Competitive Benchmarking**: Compares key performance indicators (KPIs) of competitors against industry standards and the organization's metrics.
    - **Price comparison**: Look up the data from the website pricing section or marketplaces. For eCommerce products, check price point across a variety of marketplaces
    - **Generate Unique Selling Point**: <a competitor> is confident that customers will buy <a competitor>’s product because <a competitor> solves <a customer problem> better than any alternative due to the following reasons: A B C D E ([Not generic - PMM])
3. **Integration and Customization**

Based on the problem description, I've designed a multi-agent system to automate competitor analysis. Here's the JSON representation of the agents:

<AGENTS_DESIGN>
[
  {
    "name": "DataHarvester",

]
</AGENTS_DESIGN>

This multi-agent system is designed to comprehensively address the competitor analysis problem. Here's a brief overview of how these agents will work together:

1. DataHarvester will collect raw data from various sources, including websites, social media, news, and customer reviews.

2. TrendSpotter will analyze the collected data to identify market trends and industry benchmarks.

3. CompetitorProfiler will use the data and trends to create SWOT analyses and competitive benchmarks.

4. PriceWatcher will focus specifically on analyzing pricing strategies across different platforms.

5. InsightSynthesizer will generate actionable insights and unique selling points based on the analyses from other agents.

6. ReportCrafter will compile all the information into a well-formatted, visually appealing report.

7. IntegrationMaster will ensure that all the agents can communicate effectively and that the final output can be easily exported to other tools.

This system allows for a comprehensive, automated approach to competitor analysis, addressing all the key features and objectives outlined in the problem statement.

Using these agents, think about a linear workflow to finish the task, each step has a "description", "agent" and "expected_output", the step output will be passing to the next step.
Output in JSON format and put in <TASKS_DESIGN></TASKS_DESIGN> block.
(content in <TASKS_DESIGN> will create file and written to "tasks_design.json")

E.g.
```
<TASKS_DESIGN>

  {
    "step": 4,
    "description": "Analyze competitor pricing strategies",
    "expected_output": "JSON document containing price comparisons across different platforms, identified pricing patterns, and potential pricing strategies",
    "agent": "PriceWatcher"
  },
  {
    "step": 5,
    "description": "Generate actionable insights and unique selling points",
    "expected_output": "List of actionable insights and unique selling points for each competitor in JSON format",
    "agent": "InsightSynthesizer"

    "step": 7,
    "description": "Review and refine the compiled report",
    "expected_output": "Refined and polished competitor analysis report with enhanced insights and narratives",
    "agent": "InsightSynthesizer"
  },
  {
    "step": 8,

</SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>

This implementation adapts the original code to our competitor analysis system. Here are the key changes:

1. The agents have been updated to match our design: DataHarvester, TrendSpotter, CompetitorProfiler, PriceWatcher, InsightSynthesizer, ReportCrafter, and IntegrationMaster.

2. The workflow steps have been updated to reflect our task design.

3. The `create_tasks` function now creates tasks based on our competitor analysis workflow.

4. The `get_agent_for_step` function has been updated to map steps to the correct agents.

5. The API endpoints have been slightly modified:
   - `/api/evaluate` is now `/api/analyze`
   - The input for starting an analysis is now a list of competitors instead of a single idea.

6. The port has been changed to 8922 as requested.

This implementation provides a full backend for the competitor analysis system, allowing clients to start an analysis, check its status, execute individual tasks, and retrieve results. The system uses WebSockets to provide real-time updates on the analysis progress.

Generate "index.html" that connect to the server.

Frontend should have UX component to refect each agents, the overall workflow, the execution status of the workflow and results.

Certainly! I'll create an `index.html` file that connects to the server and provides a user interface for the competitor analysis system. This HTML file will include JavaScript to handle the WebSocket connection and API calls, as well as CSS for styling.

Here's the `index.html` file:

This HTML file provides a user interface for the competitor analysis system with the following features:

1. A text area to input competitor names.
2. A button to start the analysis.
3. A section displaying all agents involved in the analysis.
4. A section showing the workflow steps.
5. A status section that updates in real-time as the analysis progresses.
6. A results section that displays the output of each completed step.

The JavaScript code handles the following:

- Establishes a WebSocket connection to receive real-time updates.
- Sends a POST request to start the analysis when the button is clicked.
- Fetches and displays the list of agents and workflow steps from the server.
- Updates the UI in real-time as the analysis progresses, highlighting the current agent and workflow step.
- Displays the results as they become available.

The CSS provides styling to make the interface visually appealing and easy to understand, with different colors for active agents and completed/in-progress workflow steps.

To use this, save the content as `index.html` in the same directory as your Python server file. When you run the server and open this HTML file in a web browser, you'll have a fully functional frontend for your competitor analysis system.
