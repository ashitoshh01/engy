<PROBLEM>
Agents: Competitor analysis

The agent automates the collection, analysis, and reporting of competitor data, enabling marketing professionals to make informed strategic decisions.

### Objectives

- Streamline the competitor analysis process reduce time and effort by automating data collection and analysis.
- Provide actionable insights to marketing teams to enhance strategic planning and positioning. Allow data export through tool integration

### Key Features

1. **Automated Data Collection**
    - **Web Scraping**: The agent autonomously scrapes competitor websites for relevant information, including product offerings, pricing, and promotional strategies.
    - **Social Media**: Check competitors' social media account to gather data on followership, activities，including Linkedin, Youtube, Tiktok, Pinterest, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, Discord
    - **News and Press Release Aggregation**: Collects and analyzes news articles and press releases related to competitors to stay updated on their latest developments.
    - **Customer reviews**: Collect relevant customer reviews and analyze sentiment related to product features and services from Trustpilot, G2, Google, Yelp, and more ([Smelter AI](https://youtu.be/LqjpZS73Ewo?si=zcW7e3di_8bht-u2)).
2. **Analysis and insight reporting**
    
    Generate a report that includes that following:
    
    - **Trend Analysis**: Synthesize publicly available data sources, such as industry reports, market research studies, and government publications that provide valuable information about market trends, industry benchmarks, and customer behavior. Identify emerging trends, new technologies, and innovative approaches to help users stay relevant and maintain a competitive edge.
    - **SWOT Analysis**: Conducts automated SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis based on the collected data.
        - S - Identify what your competitors are doing well and what works for them. Do reviews indicate they have a superior product? Do they have high brand awareness? Can you test a competitor’s products yourself to see where they are performing better?
        - W - Identify what each competitor could be doing better to give you a competitive advantage. Do they have a weak social media strategy? Do they have just an online store, not a brick-and-mortar one? Is their website outdated?
        - O - Opportunities are factors that might work in favor of a business. What trends can provoke growths in the industry? What audience can also be targeted?
        - T - Define what can potentially harm your competitors’ businesses. This might include politics, new regulations or changing customer preferences.
    - **Competitive Benchmarking**: Compares key performance indicators (KPIs) of competitors against industry standards and the organization's metrics.
    - **Price comparison**: Look up the data from the website pricing section or marketplaces. For eCommerce products, check price point across a variety of marketplaces
    - **Generate Unique Selling Point**: <a competitor> is confident that customers will buy <a competitor>’s product because <a competitor> solves <a customer problem> better than any alternative due to the following reasons: A B C D E ([Not generic - PMM])
3. **Integration and Customization**

Using these agents, think about a linear workflow to finish the task, each step has a "description", "agent" and "expected_output", the step output will be passing to the next step.
Output in JSON format and put in <TASKS_DESIGN></TASKS_DESIGN> block.
(content in <TASKS_DESIGN> will create file and written to "tasks_design.json")

E.g.
```
<TASKS_DESIGN>

    "step": 3,
    "description": "Create SWOT analyses and competitive benchmarks",
    "expected_output": "JSON document with detailed SWOT analyses for each competitor and comparative benchmarks of key performance indicators",
    "agent": "CompetitorProfiler"
  },
  {
    "step": 4,
    "description": "Analyze competitor pricing strategies",
    "expected_output": "JSON document containing price comparisons across different platforms, identified pricing patterns, and potential pricing strategies",
    "agent": "PriceWatcher"
  },
  {
    "step": 5,
    "description": "Generate actionable insights and unique selling points",
    "expected_output": "List of actionable insights and unique selling points for each competitor in JSON format",
    "agent": "InsightSynthesizer"
  },
  {
    "step": 6,
    "description": "Compile and format the final competitor analysis report",
    "expected_output": "Draft of the comprehensive competitor analysis report in a structured document format (e.g., markdown or HTML)",
    "agent": "ReportCrafter"
  },
  {
    "step": 7,
    "description": "Review and refine the compiled report",
    "expected_output": "Refined and polished competitor analysis report with enhanced insights and narratives",
