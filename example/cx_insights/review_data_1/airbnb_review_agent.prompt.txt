Ethan Jones here, leaving a review for our recent stay at this VRBO rental. My family and I had an amazing time and I can't say enough good things about this property. The location was perfect - just a short walk to the beach and close to all the shops and restaurants we wanted to visit. The house itself was spotless and beautifully decorated, with plenty of space for our group of 6. The kitchen was fully equipped, which made it easy for us to cook some meals at home. 

The host was also incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the booking process and our stay. They provided detailed instructions and recommendations that made our trip so much easier. We especially appreciated the beach chairs, umbrellas, and toys that were available for us to use. 

Overall, this VRBO rental exceeded our expectations in every way. Ethan Jones and my family had an amazing time and we would absolutely stay here again on our next trip to the area. Highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a relaxing and comfortable Airbnb experience!
