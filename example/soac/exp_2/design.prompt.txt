You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software architecture.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend).
You only write the design doc with high-level structure and psudocode, no need to write actual code.  

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

# The problem to solve:
<PROBLEM>
Build a mini CRM store data like below.
Assume there is a data engine continously produce following data point in json.
The CRM should have a table dynamically receive and show it.
Should be a file database persistent.

Here's a high-level design for the mini CRM system based on the given requirements:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
1. Flask Web Server:
   - Set up a Flask application to handle HTTP requests
   - Define routes for serving the HTML page and handling API requests

2. Data Storage:
   - Use SQLite as the file-based persistent database
   - Create a table 'crm_entries' with columns: id, title, link, content, timestamp

3. Data Ingestion:
   - Create a background thread or process to simulate continuous data ingestion
   - Parse incoming JSON data and insert into the SQLite database

4. API Endpoints:
   - GET /api/entries: Retrieve all entries from the database
   - POST /api/entries: Add a new entry to the database (for testing purposes)

5. Main Application Logic:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify, request
import sqlite3
import json
import threading
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

def init_db():
    # Create SQLite database and table

def ingest_data():
    # Simulate continuous data ingestion
    while True:
        # Generate or receive sample data
        # Insert into database
        time.sleep(5)  # Simulate delay between data points

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/api/entries', methods=['GET'])
def get_entries():
    # Retrieve entries from database and return as JSON

@app.route('/api/entries', methods=['POST'])
def add_entry():
    # Add new entry to database (for testing)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    init_db()
    threading.Thread(target=ingest_data, daemon=True).start()
    app.run(debug=True)
```
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
1. HTML Structure:
   - Create a single HTML page with a table to display CRM entries
   - Include a header with the title "Mini CRM"
   - Add a refresh button to manually update the table

2. CSS Styling:
   - Style the table for better readability
   - Use responsive design for various screen sizes

3. JavaScript:
   - Use Fetch API to retrieve data from the backend
   - Dynamically update the table with new entries
   - Implement auto-refresh functionality (e.g., every 30 seconds)

4. Main HTML Structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Mini CRM</title>
    <style>
        /* Add CSS styles here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Mini CRM</h1>
        <button id="refreshBtn">Refresh</button>
    </header>
    <main>
        <table id="crmTable">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Title</th>
                    <th>Link</th>
                    <th>Content</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <!-- Table rows will be dynamically inserted here -->
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </main>
    <script>
        // Add JavaScript code here
        function fetchEntries() {
            // Fetch entries from backend API
            // Update table with new data
        }

        // Set up auto-refresh and manual refresh button
        setInterval(fetchEntries, 30000);
        document.getElementById('refreshBtn').addEventListener('click', fetchEntries);

        // Initial data fetch
        fetchEntries();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
