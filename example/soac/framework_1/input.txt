imagine there a bunch of local web server already running.
Each of them is at "localhost:xxx" serving a web page (dashboard).
Now I want a hub page, left-side is navi bar (tab), put some agent name. Right-side is corresponded iframe point to "localhost:xxx".

E.g.
"Web Search Agent" -> localhost:5000
"Web Scraper Agent" -> localhost:5001
"Social Media Agent" -> localhost:5002
"Research Agent" -> localhost:5003
"Trend Analysis Agent" -> localhost:5004
