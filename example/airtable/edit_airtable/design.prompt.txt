You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
Using Airtable API, and create an editable dashboard let me editor a datasource in Airtable like Pandas table.
Give me input to the datasource name, and my API key.
Give me button that I can dump the table to CSV
Give me button that I can refresh the table from datasource. 
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a design for the app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server that handles API requests and interacts with the Airtable API. Here's an outline of the main components:

1. Dependencies:
   - Flask
   - Requests (for Airtable API calls)
   - Pandas (for data manipulation)

2. Routes:
   - GET /: Serve the main HTML page
   - POST /connect: Connect to Airtable using provided API key and base ID
   - GET /fetch_table: Fetch data from Airtable and return as JSON
   - POST /update_table: Update Airtable with modified data
   - GET /export_csv: Export current table data as CSV

3. Main functions:
   - connect_to_airtable(api_key, base_id): Establish connection to Airtable
   - fetch_table_data(table_name): Retrieve data from specified Airtable table
   - update_table_data(table_name, data): Update Airtable with modified data
   - export_to_csv(data): Convert table data to CSV format

4. Error handling:
   - Handle API connection errors
   - Validate input data

The server will maintain a session to store the Airtable connection details and current table data.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript for interactivity. Here's an outline of the main components:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title
   - Input fields for Airtable API key and base ID
   - Connect button
   - Table name input field
   - Refresh button
   - Editable table display area
   - Save changes button
   - Export to CSV button
   - Status/error message area

2. CSS styling:
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Modern, clean look with a color scheme based on Airtable's branding
   - Styled input fields and buttons
   - Table styling with alternating row colors and hover effects

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Connect to Airtable API using provided credentials
   - Fetch and display table data
   - Enable in-place editing of table cells
   - Handle table updates and send changes to the server
   - Implement table refresh functionality
   - Export table data to CSV
   - Display loading indicators during API calls
   - Show error messages and status updates

4. Libraries/Frameworks:
   - Use a lightweight table editor library like DataTables or AG Grid
   - Axios for AJAX requests
   - Optional: Add a CSS framework like Bootstrap for responsive design

The page will be dynamic, updating the table display without full page reloads. It will provide a seamless editing experience similar to working with a spreadsheet application.
