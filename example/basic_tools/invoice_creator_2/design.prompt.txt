You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
invoice creator.
Upload a picture, input items and price, generate an invoice and I can download in PDF or PNG.
The invoice should have a table in center, the picture in left top.
The invoice also has footer, say my company name and address (I can type somewhere).
It can have preview view to show just generated invoice (in PNG format maybe).
It also has a list of already generated invoices, preview all of them and have PDF download buttons. 

```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's my design for the invoice creator app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following key components:

1. Routes:
   - POST /upload_image: Handle image upload
   - POST /generate_invoice: Generate invoice based on user input
   - GET /invoices: Retrieve list of generated invoices
   - GET /invoice/<id>: Retrieve a specific invoice
   - GET /download/<id>: Download invoice as PDF or PNG

2. Database:
   - Use SQLite to store invoice data and metadata

3. Libraries:
   - Pillow: For image processing
   - ReportLab: For PDF generation
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy: For database operations

4. Key functions:
   - process_image(): Resize and optimize uploaded image
   - generate_invoice(): Create invoice based on user input
   - create_pdf(): Generate PDF version of invoice
   - create_png(): Generate PNG version of invoice
   - save_invoice(): Save invoice data to database

5. Data models:
   - Invoice: Store invoice details (items, prices, company info, image path)

The server will handle image uploads, invoice generation, and storage. It will provide APIs for the frontend to interact with, including invoice creation, retrieval, and download functionality.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS. Key components include:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title
   - Image upload section
   - Invoice input form (items, prices, company info)
   - Preview section
   - Generated invoices list
   - Footer

2. CSS:
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Styling for form elements, buttons, and invoice preview
   - Grid layout for invoice table

3. JavaScript functions:
   - handleImageUpload(): Process and display uploaded image
   - generateInvoice(): Send form data to backend and display preview
   - displayInvoicePreview(): Show generated invoice in PNG format
   - loadInvoiceList(): Fetch and display list of generated invoices
   - downloadInvoice(): Trigger invoice download (PDF or PNG)

4. API interactions:
   - Use fetch() for AJAX calls to backend APIs

5. Libraries:
   - Use vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation
   - Consider using a lightweight CSS framework like Milligram for basic styling

6. Key features:
   - Real-time preview of invoice as user inputs data
   - Drag-and-drop image upload
   - Responsive table for invoice items
   - Modal for displaying invoice preview
   - Sortable and filterable list of generated invoices

The frontend will provide an intuitive interface for users to create invoices, preview them in real-time, and manage previously generated invoices. It will communicate with the backend via API calls to handle data processing and storage.
