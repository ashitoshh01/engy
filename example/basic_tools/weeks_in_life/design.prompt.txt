You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
create a charts show how many weeks past in my life. Assume I will live 100 years. One week per dot in this chart.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's my design for the app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following components:

1. Main Flask app:
   - Import necessary libraries (Flask, datetime, math)
   - Create a Flask app instance

2. Route: "/"
   - Serve the main HTML page

3. Route: "/calculate_weeks"
   - Accept POST request with user's birthdate
   - Calculate total weeks in 100 years
   - Calculate weeks lived based on birthdate
   - Calculate weeks remaining
   - Return JSON response with calculated data

4. Helper function: calculate_weeks(birthdate)
   - Parse birthdate string to datetime object
   - Calculate weeks lived using current date and birthdate
   - Calculate total weeks in 100 years
   - Calculate remaining weeks
   - Return dictionary with weeks lived, total weeks, and remaining weeks

5. Run the Flask app

The backend will handle date calculations and provide data to the frontend via an API endpoint.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS. It will have the following components:

1. HTML structure:
   - Title: "Life in Weeks"
   - Input field for birthdate
   - Button to submit birthdate
   - Canvas element for drawing the chart
   - Information display area for showing calculated weeks

2. CSS styles:
   - Center-align content
   - Style input field, button, and canvas
   - Create a grid layout for the week dots

3. JavaScript:
   - Function to handle form submission
   - AJAX call to backend API to get calculated weeks
   - Function to draw the chart using canvas
   - Chart drawing:
     - Create a 52x100 grid (52 weeks per year, 100 years)
     - Color dots based on weeks lived (e.g., blue for lived weeks, gray for remaining)
   - Update information display with calculated weeks

4. Responsive design:
   - Adjust canvas size and dot size based on screen width
   - Ensure mobile-friendly layout

The frontend will provide an interactive interface for users to input their birthdate and visualize their life in weeks using a dot chart.
