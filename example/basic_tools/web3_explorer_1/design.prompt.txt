You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
create an app connect to my MetaMask wallet and manage my web3 assets.
Show my ETH balance. List all my ETH transactions.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a design for the app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain and serves API endpoints for the frontend. Key components:

1. Flask server setup:
   - Import necessary libraries (Flask, web3, etc.)
   - Initialize Flask app

2. Web3 integration:
   - Connect to Ethereum network using Web3.py
   - Function to validate Ethereum addresses

3. API endpoints:
   - GET /api/balance/<address>: Retrieve ETH balance for given address
   - GET /api/transactions/<address>: Fetch list of transactions for given address

4. Transaction processing:
   - Function to fetch and process transaction data
   - Pagination support for large transaction lists

5. Error handling:
   - Custom error responses for invalid addresses, network issues, etc.

6. CORS support:
   - Enable CORS to allow frontend requests

7. Environment variables:
   - Store sensitive data (e.g., Ethereum node URL) in environment variables

8. Serve static files:
   - Serve the HTML/CSS/JS files for the frontend

The server will run on localhost:5000 and provide the necessary API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript to interact with the MetaMask wallet and the backend API. Key components:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title and MetaMask connection button
   - Main content area with two sections:
     a. ETH balance display
     b. Transaction list
   - Footer with app information

2. CSS styling:
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Dark mode for better readability of crypto data
   - Custom styles for balance and transaction list

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - MetaMask integration:
     - Function to connect to MetaMask
     - Event listeners for account changes
   - API interactions:
     - Fetch balance from backend
     - Fetch and display transactions
   - Dynamic content updates:
     - Update balance in real-time
     - Infinite scroll for transaction list
   - Error handling and user notifications

4. Web3 integration:
   - Use Web3.js library to interact with MetaMask

5. Responsive design:
   - Ensure proper display on both desktop and mobile devices

6. Loading indicators:
   - Show loading spinners while fetching data

7. Transaction details:
   - Clickable transactions to show more details

8. Local storage:
   - Store user preferences (e.g., dark mode setting)

The frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for connecting to MetaMask, displaying the ETH balance, and browsing through transactions, all within a single, responsive HTML page.
