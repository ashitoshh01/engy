The frontend will be a single HTML page with JavaScript for dynamic updates:

1. Header with title "Kubernetes Management Console"

2. Two main sections: Nodes and Pods

3. Each section has:
   - A table listing resources (nodes/pods)
   - Columns: Name, Status, IP, Actions
   - Action buttons for each row: SSH, Kill, View Details

4. Modal dialogs for:
   - SSH: Command input and output display
   - Kill confirmation
   - Resource details view

5. Refresh button to update node/pod lists

6. Search/filter functionality for both tables

7. Responsive design for mobile/desktop

JavaScript functionality:
- Fetch data from backend API endpoints
- Populate and update tables dynamically
- Handle button clicks and modal interactions
- Implement search/filter for tables

CSS styling:
- Clean, modern look with a dark theme
- Responsive grid layout
- Styled tables and buttons
- Smooth transitions for modals

The page will use vanilla JavaScript for simplicity, with the option to later refactor to a framework like Vue.js if needed for scalability.
