Here's a simple server/client design for the Hawaii weekend trip planner app:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
Python Flask Backend:

1. Main app file (app.py):
   - Set up Flask application
   - Define routes:
     - GET /: Serve the main HTML page
     - POST /plan: Handle trip planning request
   
2. Trip planner module (trip_planner.py):
   - Function to generate trip suggestions based on user input
   - Utilize a database or API for Hawaii attractions and activities

3. Database or API integration:
   - Store information about Hawaii attractions, activities, and accommodations
   - Alternatively, integrate with external APIs for up-to-date information

4. Requirements:
   - Flask
   - Requests (if using external APIs)
   - SQLAlchemy (if using a database)

5. Configuration:
   - Config file for API keys, database connection strings, etc.

6. Error handling and logging
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
Single HTML Page Frontend:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title
   - Form for user input:
     - Date picker for trip duration
     - Checkboxes for interests (beaches, hiking, cultural activities, etc.)
     - Budget input
   - Submit button to send planning request
   - Results section to display trip suggestions

2. CSS styling:
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Hawaii-themed color scheme and background
   - Clean and user-friendly layout

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Form validation
   - AJAX request to backend for trip planning
   - Dynamic rendering of trip suggestions in results section
   - Interactive elements (e.g., collapsible details for each suggestion)

4. External libraries:
   - jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests
   - Date picker library (e.g., Pikaday) for selecting trip dates
   - Optional: Animation library for smooth transitions

5. Accessibility considerations:
   - Proper use of ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation support

6. Error handling:
   - Display user-friendly error messages
   - Loading indicators during AJAX requests
