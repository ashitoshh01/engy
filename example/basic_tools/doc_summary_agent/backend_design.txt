The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following key components:

1. File Upload Handling:
   - Use Flask's file upload functionality to receive the uploaded document.
   - Store the uploaded file temporarily on the server.

2. CrewAI Integration:
   - Set up a CrewAI agent using Claude 3.5 for document summarization.
   - Create a function to process the uploaded document and generate a summary using the CrewAI agent.

3. Markdown Conversion:
   - Implement a function to convert the summary into markdown format.

4. API Endpoints:
   - POST /upload: Handle file upload and trigger summarization process.
   - GET /summary: Return the generated markdown summary.
   - GET /download: Serve the markdown summary as a downloadable file.

5. Data Storage:
   - Use a simple in-memory storage (e.g., a dictionary) to store the latest summary for each session.

6. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error handling for file upload issues, summarization failures, etc.

7. CORS Support:
   - Enable CORS to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend.

The server will use environment variables for API keys and other sensitive information.
