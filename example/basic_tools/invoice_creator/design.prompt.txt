Here's a design for the invoice creator app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following key components:

1. Flask app setup and routes:
   - POST /upload_image: Handle image upload
   - POST /generate_invoice: Generate invoice based on user input
   - GET /download_pdf: Serve generated PDF for download

2. Image handling:
   - Use Pillow library to process and store uploaded images

3. Invoice generation:
   - Create a function to generate invoice using user input (items, prices)
   - Use ReportLab library to create PDF invoices

4. Data storage:
   - Use SQLite database to store invoice data and image references

5. Dependencies:
   - Flask
   - Pillow
   - ReportLab
   - SQLite3

Key functions:
- upload_image(): Save uploaded image and return a reference ID
- generate_invoice(): Create invoice using user input and image reference
- create_pdf(): Use ReportLab to generate PDF invoice
- get_pdf(): Retrieve generated PDF for download

The server will handle image uploads, store invoice data, generate PDFs, and serve the frontend HTML page.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Key components include:

1. HTML structure:
   - Header with app title
   - Image upload section
   - Form for entering invoice items and prices
   - Preview section for uploaded image and entered data
   - Generate Invoice button
   - Download PDF button (initially hidden)

2. CSS styling:
   - Modern, clean design with a professional color scheme
   - Responsive layout for various screen sizes
   - Styled form inputs and buttons
   - Animated transitions for smooth user experience

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Handle image upload and preview
   - Dynamic form for adding/removing invoice items
   - Form validation
   - AJAX requests to backend for image upload and invoice generation
   - Update UI to show download button when PDF is ready

4. Key features:
   - Drag and drop image upload
   - Real-time preview of entered items and total price
   - Client-side form validation
   - Smooth transitions and loading indicators

The page will use Fetch API for AJAX requests and modern CSS features for styling. It will provide a seamless, interactive experience for creating and downloading invoices.
