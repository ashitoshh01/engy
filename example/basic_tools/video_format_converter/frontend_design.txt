The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript for interactivity. Key elements include:

1. Header:
   - Title: "Video Converter"
   - Brief description of the app's functionality

2. File Upload Section:
   - Drag-and-drop area for file upload
   - "Select File" button as an alternative
   - Display selected file name

3. Conversion Options:
   - Playback Speed slider (0.5x to 2x)
   - Resolution dropdown (e.g., 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p)

4. Convert Button:
   - Triggers file upload and conversion process

5. Progress Section:
   - Progress bar for upload and conversion
   - Status messages (e.g., "Uploading...", "Converting...", "Done!")

6. Download Section:
   - Download button (appears when conversion is complete)

7. Footer:
   - Copyright information
   - Link to developer's website

The page will use modern CSS for styling, making it responsive and visually appealing. JavaScript will handle:
- File selection and upload
- Sending conversion parameters to the server
- Updating progress and status
- Enabling the download button when conversion is complete

The design will be clean and intuitive, with a color scheme that's easy on the eyes for users who might be working with video frequently.
