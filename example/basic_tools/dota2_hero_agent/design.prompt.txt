You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
Create a dota2 hero analyzer and picker.
Show all heros with their basic info.
Create an LLM agent using CrewAI (with Claude 3.5), and when I select a hero, I can ask a question and the agent will answer.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's my design for the Dota 2 hero analyzer and picker app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
1. Flask web server
2. Database (SQLite) to store Dota 2 hero information
3. API endpoints:
   - GET /heroes: Retrieve all heroes with basic info
   - GET /hero/<hero_id>: Get detailed info for a specific hero
   - POST /ask: Submit a question about a selected hero
4. CrewAI integration:
   - Create an agent using Claude 3.5 model
   - Implement question-answering functionality for hero-related queries
5. Data scraping script to populate the database with up-to-date Dota 2 hero information
6. Hero class to represent Dota 2 heroes and their attributes
7. Utility functions for data processing and API response formatting

Key Python libraries:
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- CrewAI
- Anthropic (for Claude 3.5 integration)
- Requests (for data scraping)
- BeautifulSoup (for parsing hero data)

Main components:
- app.py: Flask application and route handlers
- models.py: SQLAlchemy models for Hero class
- database.py: Database connection and initialization
- crewai_agent.py: CrewAI agent setup and question-answering logic
- scraper.py: Data scraping functionality to update hero information
- utils.py: Utility functions for data processing and formatting
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
Single HTML page with the following sections:

1. Header:
   - Title: "Dota 2 Hero Analyzer and Picker"
   - Subtitle: "Explore heroes and get AI-powered insights"

2. Hero Grid:
   - Display all Dota 2 heroes in a responsive grid layout
   - Each hero card shows:
     - Hero portrait
     - Hero name
     - Primary attribute (Strength/Agility/Intelligence)
     - Roles (e.g., Carry, Support, Initiator)

3. Hero Details Panel (initially hidden, shown when a hero is selected):
   - Larger hero portrait
   - Hero name and title
   - Detailed attributes (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Move Speed, etc.)
   - Abilities overview
   - Lore snippet

4. AI Question-Answering Section:
   - Text input for user questions
   - "Ask" button to submit questions
   - Response area to display AI-generated answers

5. Filters and Search:
   - Search bar to filter heroes by name
   - Dropdown filters for primary attribute and roles

Styling and Interactivity:
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layout
- Implement smooth transitions for hero selection and panel display
- Use AJAX for asynchronous communication with the backend
- Incorporate Dota 2-themed color scheme and typography
- Add tooltips for hero abilities and attributes
- Implement a loading spinner for AI responses

JavaScript Functionality:
- Fetch and display hero data from the backend
- Handle hero selection and update the details panel
- Implement search and filtering functionality
- Send user questions to the backend and display AI-generated responses
- Add keyboard navigation for accessibility

Responsive Design:
- Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Use media queries to adjust the hero grid and panel layouts for smaller screens
