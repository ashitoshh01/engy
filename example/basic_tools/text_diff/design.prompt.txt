You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
Create an app where I can paste two versions of texts and see their diffs.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's my design for the text comparison app:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server with the following components:

1. Main Flask app:
   - Import necessary libraries (Flask, difflib)
   - Create Flask app instance

2. Route: "/"
   - Serve the main HTML page

3. Route: "/compare" (POST method)
   - Receive two texts from the frontend
   - Use difflib to compare the texts and generate HTML diff
   - Return the HTML diff to the frontend

4. Helper function: generate_diff(text1, text2)
   - Use difflib.HtmlDiff().make_file() to create an HTML diff
   - Customize the output to make it more visually appealing

5. Run the Flask app

The server will use the difflib library to generate a colorized HTML diff between the two input texts. This diff will highlight additions, deletions, and changes between the two versions.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

1. HTML structure:
   - Title: "Text Comparison Tool"
   - Two large text areas for input:
     - Left: "Original Text"
     - Right: "Modified Text"
   - "Compare" button
   - Result area to display the diff

2. CSS styling:
   - Modern, clean design with a color scheme (e.g., blue and white)
   - Responsive layout for various screen sizes
   - Styled text areas and button
   - Custom styling for diff output (highlighted additions and deletions)

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Event listener for the "Compare" button
   - AJAX call to send texts to the backend "/compare" route
   - Function to display the returned HTML diff in the result area
   - Error handling for failed requests or empty inputs

4. Additional features:
   - "Clear" button to reset both text areas
   - "Swap" button to switch the contents of the two text areas
   - Loading spinner while waiting for the comparison result

The frontend will provide an intuitive interface for users to input their texts, initiate the comparison, and view the results in a visually appealing manner.
</FRONTEND_DESIGN>
