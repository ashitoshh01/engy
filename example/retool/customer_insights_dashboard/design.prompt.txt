You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software architecture.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend).
You only write the design doc with high-level structure and psudocode, no need to write actual code.  

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

# The problem to solve:
<PROBLEM>
Create a secure and accessible customer insights dashboard that serves as a centralized control center.
The dashboard should allow users to easily look up, edit, and configure customer accounts.
Ensure data security while enabling quick access to customer information.
</PROBLEM>

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a high-level design for the customer insights dashboard application:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
Python Flask Backend:

1. Server Setup:
   - Use Flask to create a web server
   - Set up secure HTTPS connection
   - Implement user authentication and authorization

2. Database:
   - Use SQLAlchemy ORM with a secure database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
   - Create Customer model with relevant fields (id, name, email, etc.)
   - Implement data encryption for sensitive information

3. API Endpoints:
   - GET /api/customers: Retrieve list of customers (with pagination)
   - GET /api/customers/<id>: Retrieve specific customer details
   - POST /api/customers: Create new customer
   - PUT /api/customers/<id>: Update customer information
   - DELETE /api/customers/<id>: Delete customer (with proper authorization)

4. Search Functionality:
   - Implement full-text search for customer lookup
   - Create GET /api/customers/search endpoint

5. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Implement comprehensive logging for all actions
   - Set up monitoring for performance and security

6. Security Measures:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Use input validation and sanitization
   - Set up CORS policies

Pseudocode for main app structure:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_login import LoginManager, login_required

app = Flask(__name__)
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
login_manager = LoginManager(app)

class Customer(db.Model):
    # Define customer model

@app.route('/api/customers', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def get_customers():
    # Implement pagination and return customer list

@app.route('/api/customers/<int:id>', methods=['GET', 'PUT', 'DELETE'])
@login_required
def manage_customer(id):
    # Implement CRUD operations for single customer

@app.route('/api/customers/search', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def search_customers():
    # Implement search functionality

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')
```
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
Single Page HTML/JavaScript Frontend:

1. Layout:
   - Responsive design using CSS Grid or Flexbox
   - Header with logo and user info
   - Sidebar for navigation
   - Main content area for customer data display and editing

2. Components:
   - Login form
   - Customer list table (sortable and paginated)
   - Customer detail view/edit form
   - Search bar with auto-suggest
   - Modal for confirmations (e.g., delete customer)

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Use Fetch API for AJAX calls to backend
   - Implement client-side form validation
   - Dynamic updating of customer list and details
   - Implement debounce for search input

4. Security Measures:
   - Implement CSP (Content Security Policy)
   - Use HttpOnly cookies for authentication
   - Sanitize user inputs

5. Accessibility:
   - Ensure proper ARIA labels
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Use semantic HTML elements

Pseudocode for main HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Customer Insights Dashboard</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Logo and user info -->
    </header>
    
    <nav>
        <!-- Sidebar navigation -->
    </nav>
    
    <main>
        <section id="customer-list">
            <!-- Search bar -->
            <!-- Paginated customer table -->
        </section>
        
        <section id="customer-details" hidden>
            <!-- Customer detail view/edit form -->
        </section>
    </main>
    
    <div id="modal" hidden>
        <!-- Modal for confirmations -->
    </div>
    
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

JavaScript pseudocode:

```javascript
// Event listeners
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp);

// Initialize app
function initApp() {
    fetchCustomers();
    setupEventListeners();
}

// Fetch customers from API
async function fetchCustomers() {
    // Use Fetch API to get customers and update DOM
}

// Setup event listeners
function setupEventListeners() {
    // Add listeners for search, sort, edit, delete actions
}

// Handle customer edit
function editCustomer(id) {
    // Show edit form and handle submission
}

// Handle customer delete
function deleteCustomer(id) {
    // Show confirmation modal and handle deletion
}

// Search functionality
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search');
searchInput.addEventListener('input', debounce(handleSearch, 300));

function handleSearch() {
    // Perform search and update customer list
}

// Debounce function
function debounce(func, delay) {
    // Implement debounce logic
}
```
