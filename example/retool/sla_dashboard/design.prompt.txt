You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software architecture.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend).
You only write the design doc with high-level structure and psudocode, no need to write actual code.  

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

# The problem to solve:
<PROBLEM>
If youâ€™re managing a customer support team, you want to ensure your team is providing the best possible customer experience and adhering to agreed-upon SLAs with customers.
Building a dashboard that offers visibility into team performance helps keep track of key support metrics like ticket volume, response time, and time to resolution.

Assume we have a database about person, ticket and response time.
Have a way to generate random data.

Have banner/ticker to show overview.
</PROBLEM>

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Certainly! I'll design a simple customer support dashboard app with a Python backend and a single HTML page frontend based on the given description. Here's the high-level design for both components:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
1. Flask Web Server:
   - Set up a Flask app to serve the dashboard

2. Database Models:
   - Person: id, name, role
   - Ticket: id, customer_id, agent_id, status, created_at, resolved_at
   - Response: id, ticket_id, agent_id, timestamp

3. Data Generation:
   - Create a function to generate random data for testing
   - Populate the database with sample data

4. API Endpoints:
   - GET /api/dashboard: Return all dashboard data
   - GET /api/tickets: Return ticket data
   - GET /api/agents: Return agent performance data

5. Dashboard Data Calculation:
   - Calculate ticket volume
   - Calculate average response time
   - Calculate average time to resolution
   - Calculate SLA adherence

6. Main Application:
   - Set up routes
   - Implement data generation
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Serve the HTML page

Pseudocode for main.py:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, render_template
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

app = Flask(__name__)

# Database models (using SQLAlchemy or similar ORM)
# ... Person, Ticket, Response models ...

# Data generation function
def generate_random_data():
    # ... Generate random persons, tickets, and responses ...

# Dashboard data calculation functions
def calculate_ticket_volume():
    # ... Calculate ticket volume ...

def calculate_avg_response_time():
    # ... Calculate average response time ...

def calculate_avg_resolution_time():
    # ... Calculate average time to resolution ...

def calculate_sla_adherence():
    # ... Calculate SLA adherence ...

# API endpoints
@app.route('/api/dashboard')
def get_dashboard_data():
    # ... Collect and return all dashboard data ...

@app.route('/api/tickets')
def get_ticket_data():
    # ... Return ticket data ...

@app.route('/api/agents')
def get_agent_data():
    # ... Return agent performance data ...

# Serve the HTML page
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    generate_random_data()
    app.run(debug=True)
```
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
1. HTML Structure:
   - Header with app title
   - Dashboard overview banner/ticker
   - Main content area with charts and tables
   - Sidebar for filtering options

2. CSS Styling:
   - Responsive layout
   - Clean, modern design
   - Color scheme for different status and performance indicators

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Fetch data from backend API
   - Render charts using Chart.js
   - Update dashboard in real-time
   - Implement filtering and sorting options

4. Dashboard Components:
   - Ticket volume chart
   - Response time chart
   - Time to resolution chart
   - SLA adherence chart
   - Agent performance table
   - Recent tickets table

5. Interactivity:
   - Clickable charts for detailed views
   - Sortable tables
   - Date range selector for historical data

Pseudocode for index.html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Customer Support Dashboard</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Customer Support Dashboard</h1>
    </header>

    <div id="overview-banner">
        <!-- Ticker with key metrics -->
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <aside>
            <!-- Filtering options -->
        </aside>

        <main>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="ticket-volume-chart"></canvas>
                <canvas id="response-time-chart"></canvas>
                <canvas id="resolution-time-chart"></canvas>
                <canvas id="sla-adherence-chart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <div class="table-container">
                <table id="agent-performance-table">
                    <!-- Agent performance data -->
                </table>

                <table id="recent-tickets-table">
                    <!-- Recent tickets data -->
                </table>
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>

    <script src="dashboard.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Pseudocode for dashboard.js:

```javascript
// Fetch dashboard data from the backend
async function fetchDashboardData() {
    // ... Fetch data from /api/dashboard endpoint ...
}

// Render charts using Chart.js
function renderCharts(data) {
    // ... Create and update charts ...
}

// Update tables with latest data
function updateTables(data) {
    // ... Update agent performance and recent tickets tables ...
}

// Initialize dashboard
async function initDashboard() {
    const data = await fetchDashboardData();
    renderCharts(data);
    updateTables(data);
    updateOverviewBanner(data);
}

// Update dashboard in real-time
setInterval(initDashboard, 60000); // Update every minute

// Event listeners for interactivity
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    initDashboard();
    // ... Add event listeners for filtering and sorting ...
});
```
</FRONTEND_DESIGN>

I've created the high-level design for both the backend and frontend components of the customer support dashboard app. The backend is designed using Flask and includes data models, random data generation, API endpoints, and dashboard data calculations. The frontend is a single HTML page with JavaScript for fetching data, rendering charts, and updating the dashboard in real-time.
