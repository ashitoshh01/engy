You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software architecture.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend).
You only write the design doc with high-level structure and psudocode, no need to write actual code.  

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

# The problem to solve:
<PROBLEM>
Accounting manager
Keeping track of income and expenses is not such an easy task for accountants and controllers at any size-able company.
Connet to an imaginary internal database.
The database has customer trasactions. columns: "Week", "Deposit Complete Amount", "Withdraw Complete Amount", "Deposit Amount", "Deposit Other Amount", "Withdraw Amount", "Withdraw Other Amount".
Has ways to add, edit, remove rows. Paginations as well.
</PROBLEM>

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Certainly! I'll design a simple web application with a Python backend and a single HTML page frontend to address the accounting manager's needs. Here's the high-level design for both components:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
1. Flask Web Server:
   - Use Flask to create a RESTful API
   - Implement CORS for cross-origin requests

2. Database Connection:
   - Use SQLAlchemy ORM to connect to the imaginary internal database
   - Create a Transaction model with fields: id, week, deposit_complete_amount, withdraw_complete_amount, deposit_amount, deposit_other_amount, withdraw_amount, withdraw_other_amount

3. API Endpoints:
   a. GET /api/transactions
      - Retrieve paginated list of transactions
      - Accept query parameters for pagination (page, per_page)
   
   b. POST /api/transactions
      - Add a new transaction
      - Validate input data
   
   c. PUT /api/transactions/<id>
      - Update an existing transaction
      - Validate input data
   
   d. DELETE /api/transactions/<id>
      - Remove a transaction

4. Data Validation:
   - Implement input validation for all POST and PUT requests
   - Ensure data types and ranges are correct

5. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes

6. Logging:
   - Implement logging for all database operations and API requests

Pseudocode for main app structure:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Transaction(db.Model):
    # Define model fields

@app.route('/api/transactions', methods=['GET'])
def get_transactions():
    # Implement pagination and return transactions

@app.route('/api/transactions', methods=['POST'])
def add_transaction():
    # Validate input and add new transaction

@app.route('/api/transactions/<int:id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_transaction(id):
    # Validate input and update transaction

@app.route('/api/transactions/<int:id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_transaction(id):
    # Delete transaction

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
1. Single HTML Page Structure:
   - Header with app title
   - Main content area for displaying transactions
   - Form for adding/editing transactions
   - Pagination controls

2. CSS Styling:
   - Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap for responsive design
   - Custom styles for table, forms, and buttons

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Use Vue.js for reactive data binding and component-based architecture
   - Implement AJAX calls to interact with the backend API

4. Components:
   a. TransactionTable
      - Display transactions in a table format
      - Implement sorting functionality for columns
   
   b. TransactionForm
      - Form for adding and editing transactions
      - Input validation before submission
   
   c. Pagination
      - Controls for navigating through pages of transactions

5. Features:
   - Add new transaction
   - Edit existing transaction (inline or modal)
   - Delete transaction with confirmation
   - Sort transactions by clicking on column headers
   - Paginate through transactions

6. Error Handling:
   - Display error messages for failed API requests
   - Show loading indicators during API calls

Pseudocode for main HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Accounting Manager</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
        <header>
            <h1>Accounting Manager</h1>
        </header>
        
        <main>
            <transaction-form @add-transaction="addTransaction"></transaction-form>
            
            <transaction-table 
                :transactions="transactions"
                @edit-transaction="editTransaction"
                @delete-transaction="deleteTransaction"
            ></transaction-table>
            
            <pagination 
                :current-page="currentPage"
                :total-pages="totalPages"
                @page-changed="changePage"
            ></pagination>
        </main>
    </div>

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.14/dist/vue.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

The `app.js` file will contain the Vue.js application logic, including the component definitions and methods for interacting with the backend API.
