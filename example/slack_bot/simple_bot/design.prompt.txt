Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.

The app description:
```
create a simple Slack bot, that I can connect to slack, click a button to send message.
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's a design for a simple Slack bot app with a backend server and a single HTML page frontend:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
The backend will be a Python Flask server that handles the Slack bot functionality and provides an API endpoint for the frontend to interact with. Here's the basic structure:

1. Dependencies:
   - Flask
   - slackclient (Slack API library)

2. Main components:
   - Flask app initialization
   - Slack client initialization with bot token
   - API endpoint to send a message to Slack
   - Configuration for Slack bot (token, channel)

3. Key functions:
   - send_slack_message(message): Uses the Slack client to send a message to a predefined channel
   - api_send_message(): Handles the POST request from the frontend and calls send_slack_message()

4. Routes:
   - POST /api/send_message: Endpoint for sending a message to Slack

5. Error handling:
   - Try-except blocks for Slack API calls
   - Proper error responses for API endpoints

The server will run on localhost:5000 by default.
</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
The frontend will be a single HTML page with minimal JavaScript to interact with the backend API. Here's the structure:

1. HTML structure:
   - Simple header with the app title
   - Input field for the message
   - Button to send the message
   - Status area to display success/error messages

2. CSS styling:
   - Clean, modern design
   - Responsive layout
   - Styled input field and button

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Event listener for the send button
   - Fetch API to send POST request to the backend
   - Functions to update the status area with success/error messages

4. Key features:
   - Real-time feedback on message sending status
   - Disable button while sending to prevent multiple submissions
   - Clear input field after successful send

The HTML file will include inline CSS and JavaScript for simplicity, but these could be separated into different files for a more complex application.
