The frontend will be a single HTML page with minimal JavaScript to interact with the backend API. Here's the structure:

1. HTML structure:
   - Simple header with the app title
   - Input field for the message
   - Button to send the message
   - Status area to display success/error messages

2. CSS styling:
   - Clean, modern design
   - Responsive layout
   - Styled input field and button

3. JavaScript functionality:
   - Event listener for the send button
   - Fetch API to send POST request to the backend
   - Functions to update the status area with success/error messages

4. Key features:
   - Real-time feedback on message sending status
   - Disable button while sending to prevent multiple submissions
   - Clear input field after successful send

The HTML file will include inline CSS and JavaScript for simplicity, but these could be separated into different files for a more complex application.
