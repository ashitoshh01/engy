You are Claude, an AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model, specialized in software development.
You are a software designer.
Your job to design an app. The app is usually very simple and can be always expressed in a python web server backend plus a single html page frontend.
The given input is the app description.
Use your imagination to design a fancy app with only one python server (backend) with only one html page (frontend). 

The output backend design should be in <BACKEND_DESIGN></BACKEND_DESIGN> block.
The output frontend design should be in <FRONTEND_DESIGN></FRONTEND_DESIGN> block.
There should be exactly one <BACKEND_DESIGN> and one <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.

The app description:
```
Create a Slack bot named "Kim" who is a manager assistant help check-in team members weekly report.
There is a button that I can click to upload some docs (to local folder) so Kim can view the doc.
There should be a way to select interval days (e.g. every 2 days, every Friday).
The slack bot will schedule check-in messages to all team members periodically based on the interval days.
There should be a calendar highlight every scheduled sending dates.
There is a table summaring all team member name with their last check-in date and current weekly report.
There should be a way I can add team member (name and slack id)
```

Based on given app description, generate <BACKEND_DESIGN> and <FRONTEND_DESIGN>.
<BACKEND_DESIGN> will be written in "backend_design.txt".
<FRONTEND_DESIGN> will be written in "frontend_design.txt".

Here's my design for the Slack bot manager assistant app based on your description:

<BACKEND_DESIGN>
Python Flask server with the following key components:

1. Slack API Integration:
   - Use slackclient library to interact with Slack API
   - Implement functions to send messages, read responses, and handle events

2. Document Management:
   - Create a /upload endpoint to handle document uploads
   - Store uploaded documents in a local folder

3. Scheduling System:
   - Use APScheduler library to manage periodic check-ins
   - Implement functions to create, update, and delete schedules

4. Database:
   - Use SQLite for simplicity
   - Tables:
     - team_members (id, name, slack_id, last_check_in, current_report)
     - schedules (id, interval_days, day_of_week)

5. Main Application Logic:
   - Implement check-in message sending functionality
   - Process responses from team members
   - Update database with check-in information

6. API Endpoints:
   - /add_member: Add a new team member
   - /get_members: Retrieve all team members
   - /update_schedule: Update check-in schedule
   - /get_schedule: Retrieve current schedule

7. Calendar Functionality:
   - Implement a function to generate calendar data with highlighted dates

8. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms

</BACKEND_DESIGN>

<FRONTEND_DESIGN>
Single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS:

1. Header:
   - Title: "Kim - Slack Bot Manager Assistant"
   - Subtitle: "Weekly Report Check-in System"

2. Document Upload Section:
   - File input button labeled "Upload Documents"
   - Progress bar for upload status
   - List of uploaded documents

3. Schedule Configuration:
   - Dropdown to select interval (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
   - If weekly selected, show day of week picker
   - "Update Schedule" button

4. Calendar View:
   - Interactive calendar component (use FullCalendar.js)
   - Highlight scheduled check-in dates
   - Allow clicking on dates to view details

5. Team Member Management:
   - Form to add new team members (name and Slack ID fields)
   - "Add Member" button

6. Team Member Summary Table:
   - Sortable and filterable table with columns:
     - Name
     - Slack ID
     - Last Check-in Date
     - Current Weekly Report Status
   - "Refresh" button to update data

7. Slack Bot Status:
   - Display current status of the Slack bot (online/offline)
   - Last activity timestamp

8. Responsive Design:
   - Use CSS media queries to ensure mobile-friendly layout

9. JavaScript Functionality:
   - AJAX calls to backend API endpoints
   - Dynamic updates of calendar and table data
   - Form validation for adding team members and updating schedule

10. Styling:
    - Clean, modern design with a color scheme matching Slack's branding
    - Use CSS animations for smooth transitions and loading states
