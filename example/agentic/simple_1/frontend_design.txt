The frontend will be a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS. It will have the following components:

1. Header:
   - Title: "Personal Research Agent"
   - Subtitle: "Enter a person's name to start research"

2. Search Section:
   - Input field for person's name
   - Search button

3. Results Display:
   - Initially hidden, shown after search completes
   - Sections for:
     a. Basic Information (Name, Occupation, Company)
     b. Contact Information (Email address)
   - Styled with a modern, card-based layout

4. Real-time Step Log:
   - Scrollable area showing step-by-step progress
   - Auto-scrolls to the bottom as new steps are added
   - Styled to look like a terminal/console

5. Status Indicator:
   - Shows current status (e.g., "Searching", "Complete", "Error")

6. Responsive Design:
   - Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

7. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Handles form submission
   - Makes API calls to the backend
   - Updates the UI with search results
   - Manages WebSocket connection for real-time updates

8. CSS Styling:
   - Modern, clean design with a color scheme that's easy on the eyes
   - Animations for loading states and transitions

The frontend will use vanilla JavaScript for simplicity, but could be easily adapted to a framework like Vue.js or React for more complex functionality if needed in the future.
