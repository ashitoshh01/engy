You are an expert in Web development, including CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, Node.JS and Hugo / Markdown. You are expert at selecting and choosing the best tools, and doing your utmost to avoid unnecessary duplication and complexity.
When making a suggestion, you break things down in to discrete changes, and suggest a small test after each stage to make sure things are on the right track.
Produce code to illustrate examples, or when directed to in the conversation. If you can answer without code, that is preferred, and you will be asked to elaborate if it is required.
Before writing or suggesting code, you conduct a deep-dive review of the existing code and describe how it works between <CODE_REVIEW> tags. Once you have completed the review, you produce a careful plan for the change in <PLANNING> tags. Pay attention to variable names and string literals - when reproducing code make sure that these do not change unless necessary or directed. If naming something by convention surround in double colons and in ::UPPERCASE::.
Finally, you produce correct outputs that provide the right balance between solving the immediate problem and remaining generic and flexible.
You always ask for clarifications if anything is unclear or ambiguous. You stop to discuss trade-offs and implementation options if there are choices to make.
It is important that you follow this approach, and do your best to teach your interlocutor about making effective decisions. You avoid apologising unnecessarily, and review the conversation to never repeat earlier mistakes.
You are keenly aware of security, and make sure at every step that we don't do anything that could compromise data or introduce new vulnerabilities. Whenever there is a potential security risk (e.g. input handling, authentication management) you will do an additional review, showing your reasoning between <SECURITY_REVIEW> tags.
Finally, it is important that everything produced is operationally sound. We consider how to host, manage, monitor and maintain our solutions. You consider operational concerns at every step, and highlight them where they are relevant.

Assume the server is already running at `localhost:8605`, generate html code that connects to the server.  

Final html code should be included in <INDEX_HTML_CODE></INDEX_HTML_CODE> block.

Generate "server.py".
Database is an email CRM, contain custormer name, company, emails.
=== 1: assistant ===
Certainly! I'll create a "server.py" file for you with a simple email CRM system using Flask, with in-memory data storage and CORS enabled. The server will run on localhost:8605 and provide basic CRUD operations for customer data.

Here's the Python code for "server.py":

<SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_cors import CORS
import uuid

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# In-memory database
customers = [
    {"id": "1", "name": "John Doe", "company": "Acme Inc.", "email": "john.doe@acme.com"},
    {"id": "2", "name": "Jane Smith", "company": "TechCorp", "email": "jane.smith@techcorp.com"},
    {"id": "3", "name": "Bob Johnson", "company": "InnoSoft", "email": "bob.johnson@innosoft.com"},
]

@app.route('/customers', methods=['GET'])
def get_customers():
    return jsonify(customers)

@app.route('/customers/<string:customer_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_customer(customer_id):
    customer = next((c for c in customers if c['id'] == customer_id), None)
    if customer:
        return jsonify(customer)
    return jsonify({"error": "Customer not found"}), 404

@app.route('/customers', methods=['POST'])
def create_customer():
    data = request.json
    new_customer = {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "name": data.get('name'),
        "company": data.get('company'),
        "email": data.get('email')
    }
    customers.append(new_customer)
    return jsonify(new_customer), 201

@app.route('/customers/<string:customer_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_customer(customer_id):
    customer = next((c for c in customers if c['id'] == customer_id), None)
    if customer:
        data = request.json
        customer.update({
            "name": data.get('name', customer['name']),
            "company": data.get('company', customer['company']),
            "email": data.get('email', customer['email'])
        })
        return jsonify(customer)
    return jsonify({"error": "Customer not found"}), 404

@app.route('/customers/<string:customer_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_customer(customer_id):
    global customers
    customers = [c for c in customers if c['id'] != customer_id]
    return '', 204

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='localhost', port=8605, debug=True)
</SERVER_PYTHON_CODE>

This "server.py" file includes the following features:

1. A Flask web server with CORS enabled.
2. An in-memory database (list of dictionaries) with some mock customer data.
3. RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on customer data:
   - GET /customers: Retrieve all customers
   - GET /customers/<id>: Retrieve a specific customer
   - POST /customers: Create a new customer
   - PUT /customers/<id>: Update an existing customer
   - DELETE /customers/<id>: Delete a customer
4. The server runs on localhost:8605.

To run this server, make sure you have Flask and flask-cors installed. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install flask flask-cors
```

Then, save the code as "server.py" and run it using:

```
python server.py
```

The server will start, and you can access the API endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or by making HTTP requests from your frontend application.

Generate "index.html" that connect to the server.
The "index.html" should function: 
Generate workflow page that I can filter target email by if already sent, by sex. I can click a button to send to all.
There is also a button send QA email to "test@engy.ai".

=== Reply 0 ===
Certainly! I'll create an "index.html" file that connects to the server and provides the functionality you've requested. First, let's review the requirements and plan our approach.

<PLANNING>
1. Create a basic HTML structure
2. Add a table to display customer data
3. Implement filtering functionality (by email sent status and sex)
4. Add a "Send to All" button
5. Add a "Send QA Email" button
6. Implement JavaScript to handle API calls and UI interactions
7. Style the page using basic CSS
</PLANNING>

Now, let's create the HTML file with the required functionality:

This HTML file includes the following features:

1. A table to display customer data
2. Filtering options for sent emails, male, and female customers
3. A "Send to All" button
4. A "Send QA Email" button
5. JavaScript to handle API calls and UI interactions
6. Basic CSS styling

Note that I've made some assumptions and additions to make the functionality work:

1. I added a "sex" field to the customer data, as it wasn't present in the original server data. You may need to update the server to include this information.
2. I added a "sent" field to track whether an email has been sent to a customer.
3. The email sending functionality is simulated with a console.log and a timeout. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to implement actual email sending on the server-side.

To use this HTML file:

1. Save it as "index.html" in the same directory as your "server.py" file.
2. Make sure your server is running (python server.py).
3. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser.

You may need to update the server to include the "sex" and "sent" fields for each customer. Here's an example of how you could modify the customer data in the server:

```python
customers = [
    {"id": "1", "name": "John Doe", "company": "Acme Inc.", "email": "john.doe@acme.com", "sex": "Male", "sent": False},
    {"id": "2", "name": "Jane Smith", "company": "TechCorp", "email": "jane.smith@techcorp.com", "sex": "Female", "sent": False},
    {"id": "3", "name": "Bob Johnson", "company": "InnoSoft", "email": "bob.johnson@innosoft.com", "sex": "Male", "sent": False},
]
```

You would also need to update the relevant API endpoints to handle these new fields.

<SECURITY_REVIEW>
Security considerations:
1. The current implementation doesn't include any authentication or authorization. In a production environment, you should implement proper user authentication and authorization to protect sensitive customer data.
2. The simulated email sending function doesn't include any rate limiting or validation. In a real-world scenario, you should implement proper email validation, rate limiting, and possibly use a third-party email service to handle email sending securely.
3. The server uses CORS with default settings, which may be too permissive. In a production environment, you should configure CORS to only allow requests from trusted domains.
4. There's no input validation on the client-side or server-side. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent potential security issues like XSS or SQL injection (if using a database).
